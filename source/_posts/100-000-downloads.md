Iâ€™m a little late in posting this, but I wanted to thank everyone who has downloaded and used my apps. This past week, I crossed 100,000 combined downloads of [What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone), [Stirling Birthday](/StirlingBirthday/WindowsPhone), and [Stirling Money](/StirlingMoney/WindowsPhone) in the [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/store/publishers?publisherId=Shane%2BChurch&appId=b3f595ea-10ba-4b1c-8833-3b299078010d)! Thanks again for your support and feedback!
