<font face="Arial">Last night the Rockies beat the Padres 2-1 in the longest game in franchise history, 22 innings.  It was a wonderful game, scoreless until the 14th, when both teams scored one run.  The Rockies finally went ahead for good in the top of the 22nd when Troy Tulowitzki doubled in Willy Taveras.  The game started at 8:05 pm Mountain time and ended 6 hours and 16 minutes later.  The teams combined for 15 pitchers and 658 pitches in the game.  Unfortunately I didn't see the ending, or even a run, as I fell asleep in the 12th inning. </font>
