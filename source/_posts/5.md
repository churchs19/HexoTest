Today I've put up a lot of new photos that I've taken. I've been really busy lately. The inventory system I built for the Building 559 Laboratory is finally in production. I've also been busy with a ton of other stuff. Last Saturday I went and watched CU defeat Baylor 34-0 and then I went and watched the State Marching Championships. My HS, Pomona, won their 8th state championship in the last 9 years.
