Someone definitely didn't get the message that it was supposed to be summertime.  I woke up to a half inch of snow on the ground and a near blizzard this morning.  Two days ago it was 84 degrees!  While this is not unheard of in Colorado around this time of year, I think Mother Nature needs to make up its mind as to what season it is.
