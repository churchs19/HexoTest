<font face="Arial">$5 can provide an emergency health kit for one person for three months, with medical supplies and medicine to cover basic health needs.</font>

<font face="Arial">$87 can provide a basic family water kit for ten households, with detergent, soap, wash basin, towels, bucket and water purification tablets.</font>

<font face="Arial">$188 can provide one "School-in-a-Box" kit containing basic education supplies for 80 children during times of crisis.</font>
