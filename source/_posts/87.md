The extent of the devastation caused by the Southeast Asia Tsunami is still hard to fathom.  Donate to [UNICEF](http://www.unicefusa.org) to help the relief efforts.

Here are some examples of what your donations can accomplish:

$5 can provide an emergency health kit for one person for three months, with medical supplies and medicine to cover basic health needs.

$87 can provide a basic family water kit for ten households, with detergent, soap, wash basin, towels, bucket and water purification tablets.

$188 can provide one "School-in-a-Box" kit containing basic education supplies for 80 children during times of crisis.
