My third Windows Phone application, [Stirling Birthday](/StirlingBirthday/WindowsPhone), has just been published to the Windows Phone store! The app displays your friends' upcoming birthdays on a beautiful live tile. It is unlike any other app in the store in that it shows the profile photo of your next friend to have a birthday on the live tile.

Features:

*   Full support for all Windows Phone 8 tile sizes
*   Call, Text, or Email birthday greetings from the app
*   Quickly see all birthdays upcoming in the next month, birthdays from the previous month, and all birthdays for all of your contacts.
*   Call, Text, or Email birthday greetings from the app
*   Fully localized into 38 languages

[Stirling Birthday](/StirlingBirthday/WindowsPhone) is available in the [Windows Phone Marketplace](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=b3f595ea-10ba-4b1c-8833-3b299078010d) for $1.49 with an unlimited, ad-supported free trial download.
