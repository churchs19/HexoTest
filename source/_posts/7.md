Lately I have been working a lot. On top of that the weather has been cold and snowy here over the last week.

Outside of work, I went to watch Andrea speak on a panel with former U.S. Representative Pat Schroeder at DU this past Friday. IT was part of a panel called "Bridges to the Future: Examining American History and Values in Light of September 11th." It's a partnership between DU and Colorado State. They've had some truly impressive speakers so far.

I've also been hanging out with John and playing college football on the PS2\. I'm continuing to extend my dominance over him and I have him totally baffled on offense. It's great. :)
