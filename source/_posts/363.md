Since we got back from Peru, we've been very busy.  My mom came out the week after we got back, though we only saw her for a couple of hours.  Then Andrea's parents came out the next weekend for a visit.  Finally, we went down to New Mexico to visit my dad over the 4th of July weekend.

Andrea started a new job at [Project Safeguard](http://psafeguard.qwestoffice.net/) as a domestic violence victims advocate on the Monday after we got back from Peru.  She's loving it and seems to have an entertaining new story almost every day.  It's hard working with some of these situations, but it's been a very good job for her so far.
