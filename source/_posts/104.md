I don't normally post anything about work on here, but today was a pretty major milestone.  This morning we finally released the Analytical Services Management System (ASMS) into production.  I've been working on the design and implementation of this system since I was hired by CH2M Hill in November 2003, so the first production release 17 months later is a big step.
