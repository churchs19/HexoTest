Andrea and I successfully moved into our new house on Saturday.  The move went well despite some minor hiccups with UHaul not having the correct truck, and a hailstorm in the middle of unloading the second truck.  We painted on Sunday, Monday, and part of Tuesday, and that is almost done at this point.  Andrea's mom and sister got in on Sunday morning and left this morning to help with that.  Thanks again, Dave, Margie, Katherine, Susie, and Nicole for all of your help moving!  Also thanks to Connie, Diana, Susie, and Bethany for your help painting!  I'll have more pictures of the move and the finished product soon.
