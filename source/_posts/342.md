My newest niece, Morgan McKay Mulligan, was born this morning at 8:36 am at Lutheran Medical Center.  She weighs 7 pounds and 20 inches long.  Mom and Dad are both doing great.  We went over and saw her when she was about 5 hours old and she looks great!  Congratulations to Steve, Bethany, and Morgan!
