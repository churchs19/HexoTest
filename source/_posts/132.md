<font face="Arial">This past Saturday, Andrea and I took a trip on the [Royal Gorge Route Railroad](http://www.royalgorgeroute.com).  The train travels 12 miles from Cañon City to Parkdale through the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River.  The scenery on the trip is incredible, and we had a great time on the trip.</font>

<font face="Arial">After the train, we took Phantom Canyon Road from Cañon City to Cripple Creek.  The one-lane dirt road follows the route of the old Florence & Cripple Creek Narrow Guage Railroad and is capped by trips through two unsupported granite tunnels and across the only remaining bridge from the Florence & Cripple Creek NGRR.</font>
