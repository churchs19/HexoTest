A few weeks ago, I submitted an abstract of an article on the Cartegraph mobile prototype that I worked on for [EffectiveUI](http://www.effectiveui.com) to [MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/default.aspx).  The concept is about addressing the costs of building a mobile application for all of the rapidly proliferating mobile platforms (iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone) by building the application primarily as a web application using ASP.NET MVC 3 and jQuery Mobile while still being able to leverage native hardware features like the camera, GPS, or accelerometer.  A few minutes ago I got a phone call from Dr. James McCaffrey of Microsoft Research and author of MSDN Magazine’s monthly [Test Run](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee532402.aspx?sdmr=testrun&sdmi=columns) column.  The magazine editors liked the abstract, had asked him to review my submission from a technical perspective and he had a few clarifying questions that he wanted to ask.  He really liked the idea and is recommending to them that they move forward with the idea toward publication.  He commented that the abstract was really well written and also offered some advice about how to catch the readers with the concept in the first few sentences of the article.  Hopefully, with any luck, I’ll have a byline in MSDN Magazine here in a few months.
