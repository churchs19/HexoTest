Since it's been a while since I posted on here, I thought I should post a quick update.  Andrea had her ankle surgery on June 1st.  It went really well.  The doctor found quite a bit of synovitis and cleaned that up but didn't find any underlying tendon or cartilage damage, so he's optimistic that she will be pain free when it all heals.  She got the cast off on the 9th and is now walking in a boot without crutches, and is getting noticeably stronger every day.

Her parents were also here Tuesday through Friday last week to help her out and were a great help to us for the week that she couldn't put any weight on the ankle.  They fixed the toilet in the downstairs bathroom, a door that wasn't latching correctly, and the walk between the two decks that had collapsed last winter.  They were amazingly helpful.
