<font face="Arial">I've just released Stirling Weather and Stirling Weather Tray 1.0.2377.  This release fixes the XML parsing to deal with scenarios where the [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov) fails to follow their own XML specification, resulting in missing data and parsing errors.  If you are currently using Stirling Weather Tray, the application should automatically update on its next run.  Otherwise, grab the Pocket PC update from my [Windows Mobile page](WindowsMobileSoftware.aspx) or the Windows Desktop version from my [Windows Software page](Windows.aspx).</font>
