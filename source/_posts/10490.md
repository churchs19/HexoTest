They stumbled into the arrival while at Rockefeller Center to get their tickets to see the Radio City Christmas Spectacular Friday morning. Ethan was absolutely fascinated by the tree on the truck and the crane they used to raise the tree. One of the workers even gave him a pinecone and a branch that fell off the tree. Their particular photo is on the right and is in full resolution [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree_n_4239438.html#slide=3099978).
