I've been running Windows Mobile 6.1 on my T-Mobile Dash for a little over a week now. Thus far I'd have to say I'm pretty happy with it. I downloaded the ROM from [xda-developers.com](http://www.xda-developers.com/), and the process to set it up was very straightforward. The only thing I haven't been able to find yet is a birthday plugin for the new home screen.

Instructions for the upgrade are [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=415225). Note that this upgrade is not supported by T-Mobile, so if it goes wrong, you're on your own. Enjoy!
