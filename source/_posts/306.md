18 of 19!  The Rockies beat Brandon Webb and the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-1 tonight in Game 1 of the NLCS.  Jeff Francis pitched brilliantly for 6 2/3 innings and Brad Hawpe came through with a clutch 2-out hit to break it open in the 3rd.  A runner interference call went against Arizona in the 7th causing the fans in Arizona to shower the field in water bottles and other debris.  Clint Hurdle had to pull the Rockies off the field for a while to let the crowd calm down.  But the Rockies slammed the door and walked away with the win in Game 1.

**Go Rockies!!!**
