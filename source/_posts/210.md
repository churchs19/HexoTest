<font face="Tahoma">This afternoon I was laid off by TimeCentre.  I had given my two weeks notice of my resignation on Monday, so the timing was not all bad.  I will now get an extra week of vacation before heading to Des Moines for the wedding on August 14. </font>

<font face="Tahoma">At this point I can also announce that, starting September 5th, I will be working for [Fujitsu Consulting](http://us.fujitsu.com) here in Denver.  I was actually offered the position at the end of June, but we chose to delay my start date until after the wedding to make the logistics easier.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">At this point, I'm looking forward to getting married and then coming home and starting a new job after our honeymoon to Italy.</font>
