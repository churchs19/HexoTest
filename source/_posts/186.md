The Boulder Daily Camera is reporting that the 2006 National Champion CU Ski Team was invited to the White House to meet President Bush on April 6.  CU is the first college ski team to ever receive this honor.  Read [the article on the Boulder Daily Camera site](http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/cu_skiing/article/0,1713,BDC_2456_4564076,00.html).  Go Buffs!

Update: The team's visit went well with President Bush picking up on the story of Coach Richard Rokos' defection from communist Czechoslovakia.  The team entered the presentation area to the tune of "Fight CU" played by the President's Own Marine Corp Band.  Read the [full story of the visit from the Boulder Daily Camera](http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/cu_skiing/article/0,1713,BDC_2456_4603307,00.html).
