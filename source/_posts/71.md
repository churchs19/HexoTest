It's been over a month now since the last time I posted here.  I've just posted a bunch of photos from the DCI World Championships, the Holy Shepherd Young Adults trip to the Westminster Butterfly Pavillion, and my Labor Day trip to the Niagara Peninsula in Canada.  I hope you enjoy all of the new [photos](photo.asp)!
