---
Yesterday afternoon, Lauren and Cora went to the Rockies game in Cincinnati on their vacation to see some of Cora's family.  They went decked out in their Rockies gear and even manged to get on TV in Denver on the Rockies broadcast on My20.  Not only that, but the announcers even talked about them and their signs for about 30-45 seconds at the beginning of the bottom of the 3rd inning.

After the game, an 11-0 Rockies win, I received a breathless call from Cora who was so excited that she practically couldn't stand it.  They had arrived at the game very early to watch warmups and batting practice.  Troy Tulowitzki were out first for warmups and noticed their signs and made sure to point them out to all of the other Rockies as they came out.  Unfortunately Cincinnati did a parade of little leaguers around the ballpark before the game, so the Rockies couldn't come over and give them any autographs, but, at the end of warmups, Tulo waited to catch Cora's eye and flipped her the ball he had been warming up with!  They had such an amazing time that they were debating driving the 2 hours to Pittsburgh for today's game as well.
