---
After the primary yesterday, our local House District race, HD24, remains undecided, going to an automatic recount.  Out of 4,889 votes cast, Sue Schafer leads Andrea and my preferred candidate, Dave Ruchman, 2,453 votes to 2,436.  17 whole votes!!!  17 votes out of almost 4,900 cast!  If you think your vote doesn't matter, think again.  17 whole votes!

_Update - August 14, 2008 8:11 am: _ Rocky Mountain news [article discussing the current state of the Ruchman v. Schafer race](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/aug/14/schafer-ruchman-house-race-still-undecided/).  They're evidently in the process of counting the provisional ballots at this point.
