Yesterday I went to watch the Rockies play the Cardinals with Grandpa Ideker.  It was probably the first time I've gone to a baseball game with him in almost 10 years now.  We had a great time as he bought our hot dogs and beers for lunch at the ballpark and we munched on pistachios while we watched the Rockies beat the Cardinals 9-3.  It was a lot of fun and I'll look forward to taking him again later this season.
