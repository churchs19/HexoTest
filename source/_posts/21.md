I have finally made it to the point where I had too many projects for one page, so I created the [Software](projects.htm) section. In the Software section I've split the projects into four categories, [Pocket PC Software](projects.htm), [Pocket PC Themes](ppcthemes.htm), [Other Projects](otherprojects.htm), and [Palm OS Software](palmos.htm).

In addition to the redesign, I've added two new [Pocket PC Themes](ppcthemes.htm) based on pictures I took recently. One is of Ceremonial Cave in Bandelier National Monument in Los Alamos, NM and the other is of some snow covered trees at Copper Mountain in Colorado. Enjoy!
