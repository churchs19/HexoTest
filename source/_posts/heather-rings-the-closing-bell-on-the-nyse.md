Today, my sister, Heather, was among the [Volunteers of America](http://www.voa.org/) [Sidewalk Santas](http://www.sidewalksantanyc.org/) that got to ring the closing bell on the New York Stock Exchange.  She's a social worker in New Jersey for Volunteers of America.  I'm not sure how she got to do this, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.

Check out the archive video of the event (it's 2 whole minutes long) at [www.nyse.com](http://www.nyse.com/events/1230031773782.html).
