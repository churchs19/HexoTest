![Colin and Daddy in the hospital](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/Windows-Live-Writer/a865d6139cbf_74A8/16-16_3.jpg "Colin and Daddy in the hospital")Our second son, Colin Eugene, was born last night, February 9th, at 9:31 pm! He was 8 lbs. 0 oz. and 20.5 inches long. He’s such a cutie! He was 3 weeks early so he came as quite a surprise, but he was clearly ready. I ended up finishing his “daddy blanket” in the labor and delivery room. So amazing!
