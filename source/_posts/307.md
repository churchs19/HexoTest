The NLCS is coming home to Denver with the Rockies up 2-0!!!  The Rockies took an early 1-0 lead but gave it back.  Took a 2-1 lead but Manny Corpas blew his 2nd save ever to head to extra innings tied at 2.  But in the 11th Jose Valverde loses his control.  He walked 3 in the inning, including walking Willy Taveras to force in the winning run.  Ryan Spier threw a perfect bottom of the 11th to seal the 3-2 win.  Willy Taveras was clearly the MVP of this game with a number of stellar defensive plays to save the game as well as scoring a run and taking the walk to force in the winning run.

19 wins in 20 games.  The first team since the 1976 Reds to start the postseason 5-0.  Game 3 is Sunday night in Denver.  Andrea and I will be there. 

**Go Rockies!!!**
