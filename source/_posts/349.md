<font face="Arial">Today is my last day with Fujitsu at Visa.  Monday morning I will be starting a new job with [CNSI](http://www.cns-inc.com) at the Denver Federal Center.  I will be working on the Mine Safety and Health Administration's web systems there.  It is definitely bittersweet leaving because it has been a good couple of years at Fujitsu and Visa, but the new opportunity is much better for Andrea and I.  I appreciate all of the time I have spent with my Visa and Fujitsu colleagues and I look forward to keeping in touch as we all move on.</font>
