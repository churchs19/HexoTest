I've updated Weather Info to Version 2.2.  The new version contains some minor usability enhancements along with the ability to skin the weather icons.  See the included Icon Descriptions.txt file for the description of each icon.  All skin sets should be in PNG format and be placed in the \Program Files\Weather Info\Icons\<skin name> folder.  The files should be named <index>.png.  Check out the included weather.com skin set in \Program Files\Weather Info\Icons\weather.com for an example.  The skin set can be selected on the Settings tab.  All of the skin icons should be a maximum of 64 pixels wide and 64 pixels tall.  Keep in mind that the icons should be square so that the program can resize them correctly.  Weather Info 2.2 is available [here](otherprojects.htm).
