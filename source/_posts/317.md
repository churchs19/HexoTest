Last Friday, Grandpa, Andrea, and I went up to Boulder for the CU-New Mexico basketball game.  We picked up Grandpa at about 4:30 and then we went and had steaks at the Madrid Lounge before heading up to Boulder for the game.  The game marked the first appearance in Boulder by UNM since 1979.  We had all been looking forward to it since Grandpa had gone to UNM games all the time when he lived in Albuquerque, and I grew up a Lobo fan since my dad has had season tickets at The Pit for 30 years.  The game was also the debut for new CU coach, Jeff Bzdelik, and new UNM coach, Steve Alford.

Unfortunately the game was rather painful to watch.  Both teams were clearly thinking a lot as they tried to learn the new coach's system, and it showed.  Neither team shot the ball well, with CU shooting a pitiful 34% for the game.  New Mexico withstood a furious late CU rally to win 54-47 and the difference in the game was clearly the UNM 3-point shooting.  Even though CU lost, we still had a great time and it was a lot of fun to spend the night with Grandpa and to see the Lobos in Boulder.
