Andrea and I were watching the news as we were both getting ready to leave this morning when we hear the name "Terrie Ideker" come out of the TV.  We rush out and rewind the broadcast on my Tivo to discover that my Aunt Terrie was named the December 2007 9WhoCare Award winner by [9News](http://www.9news.com) for her work with Sudanese refugee families here in Denver.  9News did a great piece on her and I'm glad we managed to get a recording because it sounds like no one else in the family, including Terrie, actually got to see it.  You can read the [article about her at 9News.com](http://www.9news.com/life/community/whocare/article.aspx?storyid=82294).  Congratulations Terrie!
