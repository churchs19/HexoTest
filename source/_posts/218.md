<font face="Arial">On August 17, the day of the rehearsal, Andrea and I went for a his and her massage at [Sahar's](http://www.sahars.com/), where Diana works.  Following the massage, Diana trimmed my hair and then Greg got in to town from Austin, so she trimmed his hair as well.  Greg and I then went to check in to our respective hotels before the rehearsal.</font>

<font face="Arial">I met Pastor Mike in the lobby of the Savery at 3:45 and then Mike, Daniel, and I drove over to the Embassy Suites to pick up Greg and then go to the rehearsal at the Botanical Center.  The rehearsal went well and took about an hour and then we all left to go to the rehearsal dinner at the [Iowa Machine Shed Restaurant](http://www.machineshed.com/restaurants/desmoines.asp).  Dinner was fried chicken, smoked pork chops, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and bread. </font>

<font face="Arial">After dinner, we went back to the hotel and then Daniel, Heather, Steven, and Jason took me out to some bars for the night.  We went to an English style pub for a couple of drinks and then went to the [Court Avenue Brewing Company](http://courtavebrew.siteviz.com/) where I had the wonderful Capital Raspberry Wheat beer.  We had a few more drinks before I left to call it a night.</font>
