It is a very sad day in Denver.  [The Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/) is no more.  Two months from its 150th anniversary, the Rocky Mountain News will publish its final paper on Friday, February 27, 2009.  The Rocky was founded by William Byers in 1859, 17 years before Colorado would even become a state.  The Rocky has always been my favorite paper, both from a reporting standpoint and because I prefer its tabloid format.  It was also the first paper we subscribed to when we moved to Denver in 1991. 

Today is a very sad day.
