![1 Gallon Donor - Bonfils Blood Center](/journal_images/bonfils_logo.gif)

On Saturday, I hit my first major milestone at [Bonfils Blood Center](http://www.bonfils.org) by crossing the 1 gallon mark in donations.  I had been donating off and on for a while before making a real commitment last year to be more regular.  This year should be the first year where I make all six possible donations in a year.
