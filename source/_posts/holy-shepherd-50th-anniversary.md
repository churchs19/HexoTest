Today is the 50th anniversary of the signing of the charter forming [Holy Shepherd Lutheran Church](http://www.holyshepherd.net/).  On June 26, 1955, Holy Shepherd was born as a congregation in the American Lutheran Church (now the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America).  While many things have changed, there are still six charter members at the church.  So as we celebrate the past 50 years today, we look forward to working with God for the next 50 as well.
