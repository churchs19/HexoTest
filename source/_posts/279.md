Last Sunday, Andrea and I went to see "A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum" at the [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](http://www.denvercenter.org).  Prior to the show, we had an excellent dinner at [Ted's Montana Grill](http://www.tedsmontanagrill.com/) in Larimer Square.  After dinner we went back to the DCPA's Space Theater for the show.  It was the first time I'd ever been in the Space Theater which is a much more intimate space seating only a few hundred people.  The Denver Center Theater Company did an excellent job with Sondheim's comedy and it had a number of really hilarious moments.  The shows for our season tickets have continued to get progressively better as the season goes on and we had another wonderful evening downtown.
