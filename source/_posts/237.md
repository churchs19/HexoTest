I just finished a complete redesign of the site.  The new site makes extensive use of CSS instead of the old table based layout.  The new site also uses the [Anthem.NET](http://www.anthemdotnet.com/) AJAX controls to improve the responsiveness of the site and to reduce the number of postbacks that occur during the navigation of the site.  I have also updated the layout and graphics to a much more modern style.  Let me know what you think of the new design in the comments below.
