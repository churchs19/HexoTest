I am truly overwhelmed by the response to [What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone)! In just over a month since I released [What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone) to the [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=225b965d-d41f-440b-9e56-f03a550052e8), there have been 4,683 downloads of the app. I’ve released two minor updates in response to feedback and it is truly humbling that a simple food journal has met such a need. Thank you all for your response and please send me feedback if you’re interested in other features!

If you haven’t tried it, check it out!
