---
This past Saturday, May 16, I ran in the 1st Annual Access2Justice Sean May Memorial Run at Barr Lake.  Andrea was one of the organizers, so we got up early, picked up Lauren, and then got out to Barr Lake by 6:15 am to help set up.  The run started at 9:15 am with a 15K and 5K race.  I ran/walked the 5K in 42:41 (good for 105th of 167) and Lauren did it in 38:17 (94th), proving yet again that I'm not a runner.  After the race we hung out for awards and the raffles before helping clean up and heading home.

They really did a very good job for a first annual run.  There were 227 finishers of the 5K and 15K combined, far exceeding their expectations.  Full results from the race are at [Finish Line Timing](http://www.finishlinetiming.com/results/races/2009/access2justice/2009_access2justice.html).
