<font face="Arial">This past weekend I drove out to Des Moines to visit Andrea for the last weekend of her spring break.  Friday we went to the Amana Colonies and played tourist, visiting a number of wineries and shops.  My favorite wine of the weekend was actually a blend called "Lover's Wine" that was a 50/50 mix of plum and cranberry wines.  We had lunch at the Old Colony Inn in Amana and then went to Middle Amana where we had been told there was a guy who could give us more of the history of the original colonies in Ebenezer (now West Seneca), NY.  We sat and talked with him about the history and locations of the original Ebenezer colonies for about an hour and Andrea and I plan on checking them out when I go to Buffalo in April.  On Saturday we hung out with her family and then I drove home on Sunday.  It was a pretty quick weekend, but a good trip.</font>
