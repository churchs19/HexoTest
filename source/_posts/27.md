Well the weekend before Labor Day, I helped Andrea move to law school at the University at Buffalo. It was about a 15 hour drive from Des Moines to Buffalo. Talk about a long time in a car!

After getting her settled in, we went to Niagara Falls, Canada since none of us had ever been there. The falls are amazing. I think you could put all of the water in Colorado together and still not come close to the amount of water at the Falls. The trip was also my first trip out of the United States. Customs was interesting and I was greatly surprised that, given the current US security obsession, the questioning was much more intense on the Canadian side. It was also interesting to see the differences in basic things like street signs in Canada. It was definitely a fun trip and I'm looking forward to visiting that area again when I see Andrea in Buffalo.
