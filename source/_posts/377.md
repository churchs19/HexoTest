Last night, August 28, 2008, Andrea was priviliged to be among the 84,000 people who heard [Barack Obama](http://www.barackobama.com) accept the 2008 Democratic Nomination for the President of the United States.  I had to watch on TV at home but it was truly an incredible moment.  I was most impressed by the speeches of Al Gore, and Obama himself.  Andrea got some wonderful pictures of the event from inside the stadium as well.  To quote Hillary Clinton, "Barack Obama is my candidate and must be our next President!"
