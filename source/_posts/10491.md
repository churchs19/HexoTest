I was just looking and realized it has been almost 5 months since I last posted here. I’ve been really heads down on a project for [National Oilwell Varco](http://www.nov.com/) that we just delivered last Friday for their initial beta testing. The app is pretty amazing. It is used to visualize oil well designs in 2D and 3D and is built in pure HTML5 and CSS3 using HTML5 canvas for all of the visualizations and drag-drop interactivity. The app was built with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/), [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/), marking my first extensive use of all three of these libraries and had a back-end based on [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api). It’s the first line-of-business app that I’ve seen that makes extensive use of HTML5 canvas and I will definitely have more to say about this in the near future.

As for now, I’m just glad to be able to come up for air and catch up on everything else for a while.
