![Snow blows off our roof](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/WindowsLiveWriter/BlizzardofMarch26th_D60A/IMG_7222_1.jpg "Snow blows off our roof") Yesterday's forecast proved to be very accurate.  We ended up getting 15 inches of heavy, wet snow here at the house.  About 10 of those inches fell between about 9 am and 1 pm.  It was pretty crazy.  I ended up clearing the driveway three times yesterday and once more this morning.  I've got a couple of huge piles of snow on either side of the driveway from clearing enough so that Andrea and I can get out to the street.  But being typical Colorado, the sun is shining today and the melt is well underway.
