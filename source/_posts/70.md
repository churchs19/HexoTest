Weather Info was just selected as the "Freeware of the Day" at [PocketPCTools.com](http://www.pocketpctools.com).  Here's what they had to say:

_If you're looking for a simple, but effective, weather program and don't require it to be on your Today screen, take a look at Weather Info.  This application was just updated yesterday to v.2.4 and was developed by Shane Church. _

_Weather Info is designed for PPC2002 and WM2003, but based on a quick review it should work fine on WM2003SE as well.  There are some nice features including the ability to skin your weather icons.  The weather data is saved in an XML fomat and is provided via web connection to weather.com._

_Some folks like their weather on the Today screen, but for those that don't want another "plug-in", this might be worth a look.  As a sidenote, some of Shane's other application development projects are also available on his site and through Handango._

_Enjoy (and don't forget your umbrella!)._

On a side note, I found a fix for the "Could not find resource assembly" error that was plaguing some iPAQ owners.  The fix is to download and install [System_SR_enu.cab](handheld/pocketpc/System_SR_enu.cab) for English Pocket PC owners.  For Pocket PCs, in other languages, contact me at [support@s-church.net](mailto:support@s-church.net) and I will get you the appropriate CAB file.
