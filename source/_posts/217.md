<font face="Arial">I'm finally starting to catch up on the photos from the last 6 weeks, so I'm long overdue for some journal entries about the wedding and honeymoon.</font>

<font face="Arial">On August 12, Greg came up from Austin to throw my bachelor party.  We met at my apartment at 4pm and were joined by Dan and John.  We then left my apartment to go to the Rockies game where we watched the Rockies beat the Cubs 8-4.  We then went to the Cheesecake Factory for dessert before heading to the Wynkoop Brewery for a drink and then called it a night.  Photos from the bachelor party are</font> [<font face="Arial">here</font>](PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=WEDDING-BACHELOR)<font face="Arial">.</font>

<font face="Arial">On Monday, August 14, I drove out to Iowa for the wedding.  It was the typical 9.5 hour drive and I got into Des Moines at about 11pm.</font>

<font face="Arial">On the 15th, I ran some errands with Andrea in Ankeny in the morning.  In the evening we went to the Titanic exhibit at the</font> [<font face="Arial">Science Center of Iowa</font>](http://www.sciowa.org)<font face="Arial">.  The exhibit was really interesting with a collection of artifacts from the Titanic and an IMAX movie on the recovery of the artifacts from the wreck.</font>

<font face="Arial">On Wednesday, the 16th, I went to pick up the tuxedos and get a gift card for Heather in the morning and watched Brendan in the afternoon so Andrea and her mom could run errands.</font>
