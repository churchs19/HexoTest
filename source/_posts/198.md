I've just released Stirling Weather 1.0.  Stirling Weather displays the current conditions and five day forecast from the [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov) on your Pocket PC device.  Following the cease and desist letter from weather.com, I started from scratch and built a new weather application from the ground up using weather data from the [National Weather Service](http://www.weather.gov/). Stirling Weather gets the current conditions from any NWS data station and an extended forecast based on the selected Zip Code. Stirling Weather is only supported on Windows Mobile 5.0. For more information and to install Stirling Weather, go to my [Windows Mobile Software page](WindowsMobileSoftware.aspx).
