Last month I had the privilege of attending [dsmHack](http://dsmhack.org) for
the first time. dsmHack is a charity hackathon providing assistance to central
Iowa non-profits and growth opportunities for technologists.

This year's hack was March 2-4 at [Gravitate](http://www.gravitatedsm.com). The
hackathon begins with each of the non-profits giving a presentation on their
proposed projects followed by a "speed dating" session to ask questions of the
non-profits and to form teams. I ended up working with a team primarily from
Principal along with myself and one developer from Workiva on building a site
for the Refugee Alliance of Central Iowa (RACI).

Over the course of 48 hours, we built a Wordpress-based site for RACI,
including features like a responsive design built off of Bootstrap 4, automatic
translation, and card designs for all of the various agencies and partners that
they work with. We also got them set up on Twitter at
[@RefugeeCI](https://twitter.com/RefugeeCi) as well.

It was great that they brought in a number of refugee case
workers to talk through their needs with us, and we even had Bosnian being
spoken in the room on multiple occasions since one of our team members was
a refugee from Bosnia herself. RACI was so appreciative that they even gave
each of us one of their
["I am Iowa" t-shirts](https://www.raygunsite.com/collections/t-shirts/products/i-am-iowa-2)
from Raygun, which has turned into one of my favorite shirts!

It was a really great experience to participate in dsmHack. I found it really
rewarding to work on a project that had such a tangible benefit for a cause
I support and I look forward to attending again next year!
