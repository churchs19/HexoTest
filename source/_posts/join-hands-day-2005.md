Today I went with a bunch of people from church to help paint the Santa Shop for the [Join Hands Day 2005](http://www.joinhandsday.org).  We put a new coat of paint on all of the rooms in the Santa Shop where they give out toys to needy children every Christmas.  The day was a great success and the shop looks a ton better now.  Photos are in the [Holy Shepherd](PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=HOLY) section of my [photo page](Photo.aspx).
