Today was my first day at [Fujitsu Consulting](http://www.fujitsu.com/us).  I got to the office at 10 am and met a number of my new coworkers.  I got a new employee goodie bag that included a notepad, a mouse pad, a retractable phone cord, a Fujitsu foam stress ball, a coffee mug, and a $5 Starbucks gift card.  After that, I read some orientation materials and then began to set up my new work machine.  The laptop is a Fujitsu Lifebook N Series with an Intel Centrino Duo @ 1.83 GHz, 2GB of RAM, dual 160GB hard drives and a multi-layer DVD burner.  Then I went to lunch with John, Matt, and Tom at Chipotle before spending the rest of the afternoon continuing to set up my computer.  Tomorrow I will finally meet with my new boss when he gets back from vacation and then schedule an interview at a client site.  So far everything is going well and I'm looking forward to getting into some real work.
