As I'm working on writing my blog post on our trip to Sacramento and San Francisco this morning, I opened up [Live.com](http://www.live.com) to do a couple of searches and found that the picture of the day is San Francisco and Alcatraz.Â  It will only be there until midnight Pacific time tonight, so take a look!
