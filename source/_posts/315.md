<font face="Arial">The World Series came to Colorado last night for the first time ever.  Unfortunately it seems destined to leave as quickly as it arrived.  The Rockies lost Game 3 last night 10-5 to fall into a 3-0 hole.  Coors Field was buzzing to start the first World Series game ever held in Denver, but the Red Sox quickly took the buzz out with a 6 run third inning.  The Rockies rallied in the 6th and 7th to cut the lead to 6-5 and the buzz built again.  But Brian Fuentes reverted to "Bad Brian" and gave up 3 more runs in the 8th, essentially sealing the deal.  The Red Sox added another run in the 9th and the Rockies went down in defeat again.</font>

<font face="Arial">It was truly an incredible experience to be at the World Series in Coors Field.  The National Anthem was sung by Carrie Underwood, and she did one of the best jobs that I've heard by a major star in a long time.  Phillip Bailey sung God Bless America in the 7th as well.</font>

<font face="Arial">Tonight we head back to Coors Field for Game 4, hoping to avoid a sweep.  I really don't want to have to watch the Red Sox celebrate in Denver. </font>
