Stirling Weather 1.2.3279 on Windows Mobile Standard and 2.2.3279 on Windows Mobile Professional contains a major rewrite of the application launching logic.  The application  now remembers the previously selected location on startup.  Startup performance is also significantly improved when more than one location is available.  Stirling Weather now only retrieves updated data for the selected location on startup, refreshing other locations when they are selected.  The Update menu item still forces a refresh of all data.  This new version also requires the [.NET Compact Framework 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e3821449-3c6b-42f1-9fd9-0041345b3385&displaylang=en).
