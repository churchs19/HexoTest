This past Sunday, my church softball team finished our run through the Lutheran League softball tournament with a runner up finish, falling to Hosanna in the championship game.  We followed up a 4-4, 2nd place regular season with a deep run into the double elimination tournament, defeating St. Phillip 11-4, losing 12-2 to Hosanna, defeating Our Father 5-3, defeating Hosanna 9-1 and then finally falling to Hosanna 12-5 in the final championship game.  Thanks to Dennis Jacobsen for our new uniforms this year and thanks to everyone who played and supported us in making this year a success.
