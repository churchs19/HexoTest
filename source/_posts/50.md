I developed the Weather Info program because I wanted a way to get the current weather and an extended forecast on my Pocket PC. The weather data comes from the ejse.com web service and is cached so the data will still display if the device does not have an internet connection.Â  I plan on entering Weather Info in the [Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com) .NET Compact Framework contest. Weather Info can be found on my [Other Projects](otherprojects.htm) page.
