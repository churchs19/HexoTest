![Pyramid Updated](/software/smartphone/pyramid/PyramidScreenLandscapeQVGA.jpg)

I've updated the Pocket PC version of Pyramid to version 2.1 and the Smartphone version to version 1.1.  Both versions fix an issue where a covered king could be removed if the card that was covering it was selected.

The upgrades are available for free on my [Pocket PC software page](WindowsMobileSoftware.aspx) and my [Smartphone software page](SmartphoneSoftware.aspx).
