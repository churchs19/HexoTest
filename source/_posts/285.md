Last night Andrea and I went to see what was only the 10th public performance of Disney's newest musical, "The Little Mermaid."  Denver's new Ellie Caulkins Opera House is home to the pre-Broadway trial for this new show.  The Little Mermaid, starring Denver's own Sierra Boggess as Ariel, was a very good Broadway show already at this point in the pre-Broadway trial, though not without its few hiccups.

Two numbers before the scheduled intermission, they were forced to bring the curtain down for about 10 minutes to fix a technical glitch with the show.  During this brief unscheduled break, we got a brief speech from show director, Francesca Zambello, thanking everyone for their patience and saying how much they've enjoyed Denver for their pre-Broadway engagement.

The show does a wonderful job creating the illusion of moving in and out of the water.  The colors are great and are quite successful in immersing the audience into the underwater world.  The costuming for Ursula is truly incredible. 

The Little Mermaid will definitely be another great show in Disney's repertoire when it opens on Broadway following this tune up in Denver.  Andrea and I definitely enjoyed it and will look forward to seeing it in the future when it moves into a national tour.
