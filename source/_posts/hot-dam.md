On Sunday, Andrea and I went to lunch with her friend Suessy and Suessy's boyfriend, Clyde at [Capital Tea](http://local.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=capital+tea+near:denver,+co&ie=UTF8&cid=39739167,-104984167,1079900885662196834&li=lmd&om=1) before we went to the  [Hot DAM: Art at All Hours](http://www.denverartmuseum.org/utility/calendar/eventDetails/eventId--100984) Grand Opening of the Hamilton Building at the [Denver Art Museum](http://www.denverartmuseum.org).  The new building, designed by Daniel Libeskind, is incredible.  There are almost no right angles in the entire structure.  The new wing is an impressive facility and a great example of "modern" architecture although I do have some concerns that the interior of the structure will not age well.  There was already noticible dirt and damage on a number of the gleaming white walls and the building just opened on Saturday.  According to the [Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5053286,00.html), the event was a smashing success as the museum sold out of the almost 34,000 free tickets for the 35 hour opening event this weekend.
