Tonight, Andrea and I went to the first NLCS game ever held in Denver.  In a miserable, rainy, and frigid Rocktober night in Denver, the Rockies beat the Diamondbacks 4-1 to take a 3-0 lead in the NLCS.  Josh Fogg allowed basrunners in each of the first six innings but only surrendered 1 run.  The Rockies took the first lead in the bottom of the first with a Matt Holliday HR.  Arizona managed to answer in the 4th, but Yorvit Torrealba hit a three run smash into the left field bleachers to put the Rox up for good in the sixth.  Jeremy Affeldt, Brian Fuentes, and then Manny Corpas slammed the door on the D'Backs in the 7th, 8th, and 9th, and the Rockies are 1 win away from the NL Pennant!

Troy Tulowitzki has also generated the best chant that I've ever heard at Coors Field.  Everyone goes clap--clap--clap-clap-clap-clap-TU-LO as the "TU-LO" echoes through the building.  There is no doubt that he's become a true fan favorite as a rookie.

While this game was played in truly miserable weather, the magical Rockies run continues.  This game would have been rained out if had not  been the postseason.  But rain or shine, black jerseys or gray, these Rockies just keep winning.  The win was the 20th in the last 21 games, a streak that is completely unprecedented in MLB history. 

Game 4 is tomorrow night at 8pm at Coors Field.  Andrea and I will be there.  Bring the brooms!  We're sweeping the snakes out of Denver and punching a ticket for the World Series!
