It's been a while since I last posted anything.  Moving day is coming up this coming Saturday, May 5.  We'll be moving into my grandparents' old house near 26th and Kipling in Lakewood.

This weekend I've also been participating in all of the retirement celebration for [Mr. Whaley](http://www.wlwhaley.com), my high school band director.  He is retiring after 20 years at [Pomona](http://www.pomonaband.org), including 11 Colorado Bandmasters Association State Marching Band Championships, 2 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade appearances, 2 Winterguard International Scholastic Open World Championships, and one Bands of America National Finalist.  I will be performing with the band at his final concert, tomorrow, May 1, at the Boettcher Concert Hall in downtown Denver at 7 pm. 

Things have definitely been busy and I will post more details as I have time.
