Today I released Strike Out 1.0.  Strike Out is a baseball themed variant of the popular "Bejeweled" game. The goal of the game is to align three or more balls in a row by swapping adjacent balls. The game is over when there are no more possible swaps.  Strike Out is a highly addicting game that I play all the time on my Pocket PC.

Strike Out is available at Handango for $4.99.  Buy Strike Out [here](http://www.handango.com/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?productId=116135) or read more on my [projects page](projects.htm).
