[What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone) will be one of the featured apps in the [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=225b965d-d41f-440b-9e56-f03a550052e8) in the United Kingdom and Australia tomorrow, July 23rd. I feel truly honored and excited by this selection.

According to Microsoft, the criteria for selection are:

*   Functionality - Strong performance and stability, intuitive, and easy to navigate without instructions
*   Utility - Drives repeated and consistent use, originality and innovation, and strong visual impact
*   Enjoyment - "Make your users say 'wow'", meaningful use of Windows Phone design features, and apps that take advantage of cross-platform synergy for platforms like Windows Phone, Windows 8, SkyDrive, etc...

More details on the selection criteria are on the [Windows Phone Team blog](http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/01/31/how-to-get-your-app-promoted-in-the-windows-phone-store.aspx). If you see the feature let me know!
