I've just released Weather Info System Tray 2.3.  This update fixes an issue where the current watches and warnings were not updating consistently.  Users of version 2.2 and higher should automatically update within the next week.  Users of versions below 2.2 should uninstall any previous versions and then [install Weather Info System Tray 2.3](software/windows/weather/WeatherInfoTray.htm).
