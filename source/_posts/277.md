On Wednesday night, Andrea and I got a pass to see a free preview of the movie "[Introducing the Dwights](http://wip.warnerbros.com/introducingthedwights/)."  The movie is an import from Australia talking about a down on her luck comedienne mother trying to hold on to her sons as they fall in love and begin to move away from her.  Jean (Brenda Blethlyn) refuses to remember the name of Tim's (Khan Chittenden) new girlfriend, Jill (Emma Booth).  Jean insists on insulting her every chance she gets, trying every trick in the book to scare Tim away from Jill.  It was a pretty good movie with a number of funny moments, though it did drag in places.  "Introducing the Dwights" is in theaters on July 4th, though I would reccommend waiting for the DVD if you're interested in this one.
