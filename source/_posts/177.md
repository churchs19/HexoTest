Currency Converter 2005 v1.2 has been retooled to use the conversion rates web service at [webservicex.com](http://www.webservicex.com/). This update now uses drop downs to select the valid currency abbreviations on the get rates screen instead of using country names, further eliminating confusion about supported currencies. The list of supported countries is also listed on a third tab in the application.
