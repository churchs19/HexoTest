Saturday I went to the Denver Zoo with a number of friends from swing dancing.  The Zoo has definitely changed a lot since the last time I went a couple of years ago.  They have a brand new entrance and a new enclosure for the lions (complete with 3 adorable baby lions).  It was a lot of fun and something I should do more often.  Photos are on the [photo page](photo.asp).

After leaving the Zoo, I went to the [Colorado Bandmaster's Association](http://www.coloradobandmasters.org/) Marching Band State Championships at Invesco Field.  It was a great show by a number of good bands.  Congratulations to Dave, Erik, and Jane from Holy Shepherd for their Finals performances in [Green Mountain HS](http://www.rmnc.com/gmhsmr/), Chatfield HS, and Lakewood HS respectively.  The 2004 4A Champion was [Loveland HS](http://www.lovelandhighband.com/) with a score of 82.04 and the 2004 5A Champion, and my alma mater, was [Pomona HS](http://jeffcoweb.jeffco.k12.co.us/high/pomona/music/band/index.html) with a score of 88.80.  Pomona will also be marching in the [2005 Tournament of Roses Parade](http://www.tournamentofroses.org/) in Pasadena, CA on January 1, 2005.
