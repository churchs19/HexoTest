[![](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/StirlingBlog/IMAGE_123.jpg)](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/StirlingBlog/IMAGE_123.jpg)I'm posting this post from my T-Mobile Dash with a new program that I'm working on called Stirling Blog. It works using the MetaWeblog API. Right now, I just have it set up for my blog, but will shortly make it more generic for general release.

The photo is my desk at the Fed Center, also taken by the Dash using Stirling Blog.
