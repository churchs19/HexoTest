[Fight the Famine](http://5050.gd/?c=14) by [15 Million Elephants](http://www.15millionelephants.org/) is a new project by [EffectiveUI](http://www.effectiveui.com) that is part of the [50/50 Project](http://5050.gd/) to launch 50 projects in 50 days to raise £ 1 million for famine relief in East Africa.  The idea behind the project is to enable people to raise awareness and donations through their email signatures.  It’s pretty humbling to think that there are more people suffering from homelessness and famine in the countries of Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Kenya than the population of New York or Los Angeles.  Read more about the EffectiveUI effort at [http://5050.gd/blog/24](http://5050.gd/blog/24 "http://5050.gd/blog/24") and [get the emblem for your email, web site, or social networking profile](http://5050.gd/?c=14).
