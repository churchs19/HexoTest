![The Title Defense Begins Today - Spring Training '08](/journal_images/08spring_logo90x84.gif)

<font face="Arial">The shortest offseason in Rockies history ends today as the pitchers and catchers report to Tucson for Spring Training.  It's only a little over 6 weeks until Opening Day and the Home Opener is only 5 days after that.  I'm really looking forward to this season and I'm hoping that we'll continue to build on the NL Championship from last year.</font>
