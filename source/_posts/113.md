A couple of my friends from swing dancing, Kristen and Heidi, are going to be running/biking/swimming in the 2005 Boulder Peak Olympic Triathlon to raise money for World Vision's Put Hope in Motion Program, specifically for children in Africa with HIV/AIDS.  The triathlon is a 1.5K swim, 42K bike, and 10K run.  Check out their [website](http://www.justgiving.com/pfp/bouldertriathlon) and donate to this great cause!
