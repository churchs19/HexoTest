I haven't posted in a couple of weeks because it's been pretty hectic lately. I had a New Year's Eve party and only 2 of the people who RSVPed showed up which was highly irritating.

Then Andrea and I went to New Mexico to visit my dad. The first part of the trip was a lot of fun but we both got sick with a stomach virus on Sat Jan 3\. Andrea got it so bad that we had to take her to the ER for IV fluids. It helps having a doctor in the house because I'm sure that having my dad around cut days off of the recovery time.

After getting back from NM, Andrea and I went The Melting Pot for dinner and went to see 'The Producers' at the Buell Theater in Denver. The whole night was to celebrate Andrea's birthday. It was a phenomenally funny show. The show is definitely a sarcastic look at Hitler and show business and I can see why it flopped with my grandparents' generation when it originally debuted in 1968.

Then on Wednesday, Jan 7th, Andrea took me on a progressive dinner for my birthday since she had to go back to Iowa on the 8th. It was a lot of fun. We started at Bahama Breeze and had drinks with my mom. Then we went to P.F. Chang's for appetizers. After that we went to Cafe Jordano for the main course and then finally back to the Melting Pot for dessert. It was a great night.

Anyway, that's a quick recap of what I've been up to lately. I hope you all had a great New Year's.
