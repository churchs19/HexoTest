R You In?  The Rockies are the hottest team in baseball!?!?!  Last night the Rox downed the Yankees 6-1, guaranteeing them a franchise record sixth straight series victory.  I must admit that I haven't been this excited about Rockies team in a long time.  They've came back from being 9 games below .500 to a 37-34 record at this point and are clearly the hottest team in baseball right now.  They've moved back within 4.5 games of the NL West lead and are doing it largely with pitching, defense, and a little timely hitting.  Last time the Yankees came to Coors Field, in 2002, they scored 41 runs in the 3 game series.  This time, they've managed 2 in 2 games.
