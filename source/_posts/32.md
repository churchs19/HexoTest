Yesterday I had my 100th sale of my Pocket PC titles through Handango! Considering I started this as an experiment, I'm very pleased as to how well things have been going. It's turned into a much more involving project than I ever imagined, but at the same time it's been very fulfilling to know that people find value in the software I write. Thanks to everyone who has purchased any one of my titles. If you have any suggestions for new titles or improvements to existing ones, let me know and I'd be happy to work on them. Feel free to email suggestions to [support@s-church.net](mailto:support@s-church.net).
