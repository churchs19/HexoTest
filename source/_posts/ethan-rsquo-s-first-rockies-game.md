This year, for the Rockies’ home opener, we took Ethan to his very first Rockies game. It was so much fun! He just loved every minute of it; from picking out the Rockies players, to the huge American flag, to the fountains in center field, he had a ball. I haven’t had that much fun in a number of years. After leaving the game, he was already asking if "we could go to his very first Rockies game again.” It was so adorable. Go Rockies!
