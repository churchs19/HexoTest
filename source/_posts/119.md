This past weekend, Andrea and I had a nice relaxing weekend.  On Friday night we had dinner at [The Briarwood Inn](http://www.thebriarwoodinn.com/) in Golden, CO for our 4th anniversary. 

Then on Saturday, we drove down to Cañon City to see the Royal Gorge and visit the [Winery at Holy Cross Abbey](http://www.abbeywinery.com).  The winery is located on the grounds of the Holy Cross Abbey in Cañon City and has some of the best bottle designs I've ever seen.  After visiting the winery, we took a quick tour of the abbey itself.  We then drove out to the Royal Gorge and looked around for a bit, declining to spend the $20 per person ransom to walk across the highest suspension bridge in the world.  We then drove up to Cripple Creek through scenery that reminded me of the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico with the intention of getting dinner.  Finding nothing looking appetizing in Cripple Creek, we ended up driving back up to Denver and having dinner at Hacienda Colorado.

The rest of the weekend we hung out and then went to dinner at my mom's house on Monday night for my cousin Tyler's birthday.  All in all it was a good relaxing weekend.
