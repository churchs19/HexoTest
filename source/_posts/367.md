About 2 weeks ago, I released Stirling Weather Tray 2.1.3133.  This release fixes an issue preventing the application from running at startup on Windows Vista. This release is also updated to the Microsoft .NET Framework version 3.5\. On Windows Vista, application startup will be delayed 60 seconds due to the "startup boxing" functionality in Vista.  More information on the Windows Vista "startup boxing" functionality can be found at the [Commercial Technical Support Windows Server Performance Team blog](http://blogs.technet.com/askperf/archive/2008/03/28/startup-programs-on-windows-vista-inside-the-box.aspx).
