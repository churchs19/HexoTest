Well it's been a rough week so far.  Tuesday morning I got rear ended in the parking lot at my apartment complex.  My car's at the shop now since it's not drivable.  :(  Shortly after that, I found out that my mom was in the hospital for an unplanned surgery.  She's ok now, and is back at work today.  Hopefully the week will continue getting better from this point.  Cars fix, so that will be taken care of, and I'm truly thankful that everyone's ok
