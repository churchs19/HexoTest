Last night, in Detroit, Andrea's law school alma mater, the [UB Bulls, won their first MAC title over #12 Ball State 42-24](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283402084).  The win was UB's first over a team in the top 25, and capped a remarkable turnaround over the last two years.  Since 1999, when UB moved to Division I-A, the only I-A team with a worse record was Duke.

UB's next game will be the first bowl game in school history at the International Bowl in Toronto on January 3, 2009.  UB's only previous bowl invitation was exactly 50 years ago this year, when they turned down the invitation to the 1958 Tangerine Bowl because the stadium would not allow black players inside.  Read the remarkable story of that [1958 UB team on ESPN's Outside the Lines](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=buffalo58).

Go Bulls!
