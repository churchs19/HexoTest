After voting for him throughout the caucuses, I had the privilege today of casting my ballot for the next President of the United States, Barack Obama!  Today is a truly historic day as we have elected the first black President.  Now it is time for this nation to come together and respond to the urgency of now. 

Change has come to America!  Yes we can!
