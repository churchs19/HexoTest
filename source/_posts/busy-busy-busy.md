---
It's been a while since I updated here.  Since my last update we've been really busy.  On April 26th, Andrea put on the first ever Dining Out for Hunger event at Holy Shepherd.  We had about 50 people show up and will be donating almost $1200 to ELCA World Hunger as a result.  It was a smashing success!  Photos are here: [Dining Out For Hunger 2008](PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=DINEOUTFORHUNGER2008).

On May 3rd, we went and worked at the Jeffco Action Center's warehouse as part of Join Hands Day.  Most of the day was spent moving items in the warehouse to accomodate additional donations and to make it easier to find items when they were needed.  Photos are here: [Holy Shepherd](PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=HOLY).

May 4th was the annual Gospel Brunch at Holy Shepherd.  Andrea performed in both the Bell Choir and Chancel Choir.  The Chancel Choir was also joined by the Christaid African Band.  That group was a lot of fun and will be returning to Holy Shepherd in the fall.  Photos from the Gospel Brunch are here: [Holy Shepherd](PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=HOLY).

It's definitely been a busy couple of weeks and will continue being so for the next couple of weeks before we go to Peru in June.
