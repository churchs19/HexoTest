The Denver Post came to our Halloween Dance at the Denver Turnverein on October 28 and the article was in the paper today.  Chelsea made it into the paper (in the photo above), though the Post did manage to get the day of the week for swing dancing wrong.  The correct day is Friday, not Saturday as the article states.  Come join us with the [Colorado Swing Dance Club](http://www.csdn.org) at the [Denver Turnverein](http://www.denverturnverein.org) on Fridays with a free beginner lesson from 7-8 and the $6 dancing until 11.  Read the [Denver Post article at the link](http://denverpost.com/coloradosunday/ci_3184540).  <font size="1">Photo courtesy of the Denver Post.
