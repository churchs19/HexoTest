I have finally released Weather Info 2.5Â  Version 2.5 has been updated to enhance the management of locations in the cache and also includes proxy support. Locations can now be deleted from the cache by executing a tap and hold on the location that the user wishes to delete. Version 2.5 also includes functionality to update all locations in the cache simultaneously. Weather Info will also refresh all locations automatically once per hour if the application is left running. Though proxy support has been added for user convenience, proxy configurations are not supported.

Weather Info 2.5 can be downloaded from my [projects page](otherprojects.htm).
