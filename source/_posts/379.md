Microsoft's [Live.com](http://www.live.com) search engine has been doing a really cool series recently with images from around the world as backdrops to the search box.  They also dot the image with 3-4 hidden squares where, if you hover your mouse over that square, you can find out more about the context of the picture using the Live.com search.  Today I had a treat when I opened it up and discovered that today's image was Machu Picchu.  I instantly recognized the location of the photograph as a place where I had been standing just three months ago!  Check it out at [http://www.live.com](http://www.live.com)!  It will be something different tomorrow!
