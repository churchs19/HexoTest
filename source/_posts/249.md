The Rocky Mountain News is reporting that the [2008 Democratic National Convention will be held in Denver](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5272524,00.html).  I think this will be great for Denver and it will be exciting to be in the same city, even though I will likely not be able to go to any of the events.  The 2008 convention will be exactly 100 years since the last time Denver hosted a national convention in 1908.  More information on the Denver bid can be found at [http://www.denverdnc2008.com/](http://www.denverdnc2008.com/).
