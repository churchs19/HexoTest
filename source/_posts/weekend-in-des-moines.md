Andrea and I spent this last weekend in Des Moines visiting her family.  We drove out Thursday afternoon after leaving work around lunch.  Friday was a mix of a number of things and on  Friday evening we picked up Andrea's nephew, Brendan, to babysit him.  He's about 17 months old right now and he's adorable.  On Saturday morning we got up and went to the Farmer's Market where I got a couple of bottles of wine and we got some black raspberry rolls that were really good.  We spent the rest of Saturday hanging out at her parents' house and going swimming, before heading home on Sunday.  We had a good time and it was definitely a good relaxing weekend.
