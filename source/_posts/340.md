<font face="Arial">The Des Moines Register has a wonderful article today about Andrea's cousin, Drew Love.  Drew finished second at the Iowa State Wrestling Championships this year despite battling ankylosing spondylitis, which is a rare form of arthritis that causes inflammation and pain in joints and ligaments.  I knew that Drew had been on a special diet for it, but I had no idea of the level of pain that he was dealing with.  Congratulations Drew on a special season and a great feature!</font>
