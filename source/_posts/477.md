Backbone Aura is a “decoupled, event-driven architecture on top of Backbone.js for developing widget-based applications,” according to the project site. Currently in developer preview at version 0.8, Backbone Aura’s goal is to give the developer control over the complete widget lifecycle within a large, widget-based Web application in a scalable fashion.

As a result of this work, my supervisor approached me about writing a review for the EffectiveUI blog which just went live this morning. Read the rest of my review over at the [EffectiveUI Blog](http://blog.effectiveui.com/?p=8702).
