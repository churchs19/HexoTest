---
Last night, Andrea and I went to watch the Avs play the Atlanta Thrashers.  At the game, Avalanche Defenseman Karlis Skrastins, became the NHL's all time leader in consecutive games played as a defenseman.  The game against the Thrashers marked Skrastins 487th consecutive game played, passing Tim Horton's mark of 486.  The streak started on Febuary 21, 2000.  The Avalanche did a nice tribute to Skrastins before the game, presenting his wife with a silver Avalanche bracelet, and giving him a dual framed photo of him and Tim Horton.

However, the presentation was the highlight of the night.  Atlanta scored about 2 minutes into the game and then kept on piling on.  It was 3-0 Atlanta at the end of the first period and 5-1 at the end of two.  Atlanta went on to win 6-3 in a game where the Avs were clearly outclassed.  We had a good time nonetheless.  Thanks again to Greg for giving us the tickets as a wedding present.
