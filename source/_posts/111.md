<font face="Arial">One of the last major pieces of the cleanup at Rocky Flats was completed on Tuesday when the last shipment of transuranic waste left for the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM.  I approach these milestones with mixed emotions as it is sad to see the end of a place where three generations of my family have worked, but at the same time we are making the site safe for the millions of people in the Denver metro area.  Not that long from now I will begin my transition away from working for Rocky Flats and start a new phase in my life.  More about the shipment in the [Denver Post](http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36%257E53%257E2823506,00.html).</font>
