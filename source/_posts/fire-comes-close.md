There was a 1600 acre grass fire yesterday afternoon near my office that also caused the evacuation of a nearby subdivision.  Luckily no structures burned down, but you can see the blackened hillside just a little over half a mile from my office.  More on the fire in today's [Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4591439,00.html), [Denver Post](http://denverpost.com/ci_3666796), and the [Boulder Daily Camera](http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/county_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2423_4591412,00.html).
