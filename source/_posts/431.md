Yesterday was Opening Day at Coors Field.  I met Lauren, Cora, and Dave for lunch and then we headed over to the ballpark.  We got to watch a great game as the Rockies stomped the defending World Champion Philadelphia Phillies 10-3 to move to 3-1 in the young season.  I really think the Rockies are going to be very good and sneak up on a lot of people this year.
