This past weekend I went to Buffalo for Andrea's Barrister's Ball.  I flew out on Thursday afternoon.  After arriving, we headed back to her apartment where her friend Jamie met us for dinner so they could finish the 2005-06 Phi Alpha Delta (PAD) budget. 

On Friday we mostly hung out and ran errands during the day.  While we were dropping off the PAD budget, we ran into Andrea's favorite professor, Professor French, and ended up talking to her for the better part of an hour about Colorado politics and the University of Colorado since Professor French had been at CU before going to UB.  Friday night Andrea hosted a pasta party for PAD and had a number of friends over. 

On Saturday we got up and went driving around the Canadian side of the border.  We drove up to Niagara-on-the-Lake where we stopped to get some more British chocolates for my parents and myself.  I also collected some water from Lake Ontario for the baptismal faunt at church.  Following that, we drove back along the Niagara Parkway all the way to Fort Erie before we drove back over the Peace Bridge to Buffalo.  Saturday night was the Barrister's Ball at the Statler Towers in downtown Buffalo.  It was a good time and we danced the night away with a bunch of Andrea's friends.

Sunday we slept in and then had breakfast before I had to head back to Denver.  Photos from the weekend are on my [photo page](Photo.aspx).
