<font face="Arial">This past weekend was the 2007 [Denver Lindy Exchange](http://www.denverlindyexchange.com).  Andrea and I hosted 4 people: Maggie from Seattle, Levi from Colorado Springs, and Matt and Vanessa from Grand Junction.  There was dancing from 8 pm to 5 am on Friday and Saturday and from 8 pm to 4 am on Sunday.  Andrea and I only lasted until about 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights and called it quits at midnight on Sunday because of work.  The events were hosted at the Denver Turnverein, the University of Denver Driscoll Ballroom, and the El Jebel Shrine Imperial Ballroom.  It was a lot of fun and we definitely enjoyed everyone that we hosted.</font>
