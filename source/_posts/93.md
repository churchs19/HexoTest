<font face="Arial">Well I finally have my car back.  All of the major work looks good, but there are still a few outstanding issues.  The "2.5i" label on the rear is missing, a nut that holds the tool cup in the trunk is missing, a small section on the front bumper that was previously covered by the clear bra had not been recovered, and the cracked tool tray in the trunk had been glued instead of replaced.  In addition to this, the detailing was remarkably bad.  Assuming the parts come in, this will all be taken care of on Friday and then I can finally put Prestige in my rear view mirror and move on.</font>
