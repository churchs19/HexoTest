<font face="Arial">Yesterday, Lauren and I ran in the 2008 Colorado Rockies Home Run for the Homeless 5K.  The route ran from 20th and Blake in front of Coors Field down to 15th.  We then turned west on 15th and ran under the railroad tracks and then up over I-25 into the Highlands neighborhood.  The route then turned back north along Central Street to 20th again.  We headed back east on 20th and back down under the railroad tracks before going right on Wazee, and then quickly right onto 19th before going into the Rockies players parking lot. </font>

<font face="Arial">The final 1K of the race was around the warning track at Coors Field.  Lauren and I were definitely geeks on the field, stopping at numerous places to take some pictures, since it's pretty rare to be allowed on the field in the infield area at Coors Field.  We ran a little over half of the 5K and walked the rest, alternating between running and walking.  We finished in just under 45 minutes, a time that was probably a little slower because of our stopping to take pictures in the ballpark.  The run was a lot of fun and we're already planning on doing it again next year. </font>
