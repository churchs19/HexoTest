On Friday night, Andrea and I went to see the Lion King at the [Temple Buell Theater](http://www.denvercenter.org/) here in Denver.  Before the show, we went to [Benihana](http://www.benihana.com/) in Broomfield to celebrate Andrea's success on the Bar Exam.  We had a wonderful dinner before driving down to Denver for the show.  The performance of the Lion King was wonderful.  It is probably my favorite musical and this performance just reinforced that.  I had previously seen the show for my 21st birthday on Broadway in New York City.
