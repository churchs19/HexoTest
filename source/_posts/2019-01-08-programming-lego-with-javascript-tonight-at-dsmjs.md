Wow! It's been over a year since I last made a post here. Anyway, tonight I am presenting "Programming Lego Boost with JavaScript" at the [dsmJs](https://www.dsmjs.com) meetup at [Source Allies](https://www.sourceallies.com) in Urbandale.

I’ve been playing with the Lego Boost robotics platform lately to build a remote control for the Boost Move Hub using Angular 7, TypeScript, and Node.js. The Boost Move Hub communicates with an app or the PC through a Bluetooth Low Energy connection. I thought the community would enjoy learning about what I’ve learned in the process and some of the potential for automated Lego creations.
