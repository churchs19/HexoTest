![Me with CU Basketball Coach Jeff Bzdelik on January 31, 2008](/journal_images/mini-DSC02430-journal.jpg)

<font face="Arial">Thanks to my friend, [John McLean](http://www.agedwards.com/fc/john.mclean), Andrea and I got to attend a reception put on by Wachovia Securities and A.G. Edwards at CU Boulder.  The event featured CU Athletic Director, Mike Bohn, Head Men's Basketball Coach, Jeff Bzdelik, and Assistant Coach, Steve McClain.  The reception started out with some good food and then Mike Bohn and Jeff Bzdelik spoke about the state of the Athletic Department and the basketball program.  Coach Bzdelik then answered questions for about 30 minutes, including one of mine.  I came away convinced that the CU Men's Basketball program is in good hands and is clearly moving in the right direction.</font>

<font face="Arial">After the Q&A session, we had the opportunity to talk one on one with the all three and I got my picture taken with Mike Bohn, Coach Bzdelik, and Coach McClain.  Wachovia Securities also gave every attendee as many tickets to the game against #2 Kansas this Saturday as they wanted, and gave each attendee a Nike CU fleece.  It was a very impressive giveaway and a very well done reception.  Thanks again to CU, Wachovia Securities, and A.G. Edwards for a fun evening.</font>
