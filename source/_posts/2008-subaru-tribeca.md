Yesterday, after a marathon weekend of car shopping, we ended up buying a brand new 2008 Subaru Tribeca.  We ended up spending 8½ hours on Saturday and another 11 hours on Monday car shopping.  We drove the Nissan Rogue, Mitsubishi Outlander, Toyota Rav4, Honda CR-V, Mazda Mazda6, Mazda CX-7, Ford Fusion, Subaru Forester, and Subaru Tribeca. 

The decision ended up being between the Tribeca and the CX-7.  It was a very tough decision as both cars had lots of pluses, but neither pulled head and shoulders above the other.  We ended up buying the Subaru from Vik Biefel at Go Subaru West.  Vik is the husband of our church secretary, and ended up getting us a great deal on the Subaru. 

The new car is a 2008 Subaru Tribeca Limited.  It's blue with remote start, leather seats, and the Subaru cold weather package.  It's a really nice car, and we're definitely happy with the purchase.
