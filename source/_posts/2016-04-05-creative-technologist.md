Yesterday I started my new gig as a Creative Technologist at Nationwide Insurance. For those of you that don't know, I was laid off by Two Rivers Marketing in February and have been looking for a new opportunity since then. As a Creative Technologist, my role is working with the User Experience (UX) team here at Nationwide to craft prototype and functional user interfaces for various applications here. My first project will be working on the conversion from Scottsdale Insurance to the Nationwide Excess & Surplus branding.

I'm super excited for the new role and I think it will be a great fit to blend my technical expertise with the UX realm.
