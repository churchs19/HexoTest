This has been the best season I can remember to be a Rockies fan.  Entering tonight, we stand just one game behind San Diego and Philadelphia in the NL Wild Card.  I've been watching every game and I am just continually amazed by this team's refusal to lose.  The current eight game winning streak is the second longest in franchise history.  The 84 wins is the most in franchise history. 

During the run, we've demolished the playoff hopes for the Dodgers and put a serious dent in San Diego's.  We've watched a rejuvenated Todd Helton hit a walk off home run to launch the sweep of the Dodgers in the most exciting finish to a baseball game that I've ever seen.  We witnessed an unbelievable meltdown by Milton Bradley which has seriously damaged San Diego's hopes. 

We head into tonight with Ubaldo Jimenez pitching versus Brad Penny of the Dodgers just one game back.  I can't wait to see what happens next.  This is truly turning into **R Season!**

**Go Rockies!**
