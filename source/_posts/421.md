[![](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/StirlingBlog/IMAGE_172.jpg)](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/StirlingBlog/IMAGE_172.jpg)Our time at Spring Training is over. As I write this, we're in the Phoenix airport waiting for our plane to Sacramento. We watched the Rockies los to the Dodgers and Angels in Tucson and Indians and Brewers in Phoenix on their way to a MLB worst 0-7 record. The Indians new park, Goodyear Ballpark, and the Brewers' Maryvale Baseball Park were both beautiful. The Rockies' complex at Hi Corbett Field is definitely showing its age at this point. We had a great time watching and getting a ton of autographs. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Until next time, Go Rockies!
