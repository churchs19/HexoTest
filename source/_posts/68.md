Saturday night I went to the Drum Corps International World Championships at Invesco Field in Denver.  It was the first time the Championships had been held in Denver since 1972. During the course of the night, I ran into a number of people that I had marched with at various times in high school, college, and the 1996 Blue Knights. 

The Cavaliers from Rosemont, IL won with a score of 98.7.  The [Blue Knights](http://www.bknights.org) finished 10th with a score of 87.6.  It was an incredible night as more than 30,000 people packed the concert side of Invesco Field watch the best Corps in the world.
