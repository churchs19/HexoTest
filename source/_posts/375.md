This past Sunday, August 24th, Andrea and I went to the Green Sunday concert at the Red Rocks Ampitheater for the 2008 Democratic National Convention.  The concert was a free concert for DNC delegates, volunteer captains and others associated with the convention.  It was a wonderful concert featuring Sheryl Crow, Sugarland, and Dave Matthews.  Between the acts, various politicians including Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, Senator Ken Salazar, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine addressed the crowd.  It was my first concert at Red Rocks and we had a great time.
