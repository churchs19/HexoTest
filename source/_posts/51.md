Andrea and I went to Toronto, ON and Washington D.C. on the weekend of April 23-25.  In Toronto, we had dinner at the 360 Restaurant at the top of the CN Tower on Friday night.  The CN Tower is the world's tallest building at 1,815 ft tall.  Then on Saturday we went to see Casa Loma and the Hockey Hall of Fame before driving back to Buffalo.  Sunday we were in Washington, D.C. for the March for Womens' Lives.  It was definitely an eye opening experience as there were over a million people on the National Mall for the demonstration.  It was definitely a whirlwind weekend, but it was a lot of fun.  You can see pictures from the trip on my [photo page](photo.asp).
