<font face="Arial">Yesterday the Rockies beat the Phillies 10-5 in Game 2 of the NLDS behind Kazuo Matsui's grand slam in the 4th inning.  Game 3 is here in Denver at 7:30pm on Saturday and Andrea and I will be there.  Saturday will be the first playoff game in Denver since October 1995.</font>

<font face="Arial">In addition, the Rockies voted a playoff share yesterday to Amanda Coolbaugh, the widow of Rockies' AA first base coach Mike Coolbaugh, who was killed by a line drive earlier this year.  The move was suggested by some of the veteran players and could be anywhere from $20,000 to $300,000 depending on how far the Rockies advance.  The Coolbaugh's two sons, five-year-old Joseph, and three-year-old Jacob will throw out the first pitch for Game 3 this Saturday in Denver as well.  It is moves like this that make this such an easy team to root for.</font>
