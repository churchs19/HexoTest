The first named storm in the Atlantic hurricane season just happens to be named after my beautiful wife, Andrea.  It formed off the Georgia and South Carolina coast last night and currently has sustained winds of about 45 miles per hour.  [The story is on CNN right now](http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_us/~3/115361615/index.html).  Follow Andrea's progress at the [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov).
