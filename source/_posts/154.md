![Weather Info Tray 2.1](/software/windows/weather/WeatherInfoTrayScreen.jpg) I've just released Weather Info Tray 2.1.  This release fixes a couple of minor issues with the conversion to the .NET Framework 2.0 where a couple of assemblies still required the .NET Framework 1.1.  This also fixes the issue where the current watches and warnings did not appear until the app had been running for 60 seconds.  This new release will upgrade any version 2.0 installs, but any installs prior to version 2.0 will need to be uninstalled prior to installing the new version.  Download the update on my [Windows Software page](WindowsSoftware.aspx).
