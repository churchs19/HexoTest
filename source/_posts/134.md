Today was my first day at my new job at [TimeCentre](http://www.timecentre.com) where I will be working on developing the .NET version of their enterprise timekeeping software.  The day has had its share of the typical getting started issue, but it is definitely a good environment to work in.  I even have a cube with a window and a phenomenal view!  I'm really excited about this new opportunity and I think it will be a good move for me going forward.
