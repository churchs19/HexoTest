<font face="Arial">Welcome to my new site on CrystalTech.  I have decided to switch hosting providers from</font> [<font face="Arial">Uplinkearth</font>](http://www.uplinkearth.com/) <font face="Arial">to</font> [<font face="Arial">CrystalTech</font>](http://www.crystaltech.com/)<font face="Arial">.  Over the next 72 hours, the new DNS information should propagate around the internet and you should be automatically transitioned to the new host.  All of my email will continue to be received from both hosts for the time being, so I will get any mail sent to any s-church.net address.  T</font><font face="Arial">he new site has a number of navigation and maintenance enhancements and has been completely redone in ASP.NET 2.0.</font>
