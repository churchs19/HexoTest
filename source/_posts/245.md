It's been snowing here since about 5:30am yesterday.  The forecasters say the snow is almost over at this point, but it's still snowing for now.  We have over 2 feet of snow here.  It averages slightly above my knee with drifts to my waist right now.  Andrea and I are both working from home today.  Andrea had to go to work in the beginning of the storm and it took her 3 and a half hours to make a drive that normally takes 20 minutes on the way home yesterday afternoon.  All of the highways in and out of Denver are closed, and the airport is not expected to reopen until later tonight.  Officially, they are calling it the 5th largest snow storm on record, guaranteeing a white Christmas this year.
