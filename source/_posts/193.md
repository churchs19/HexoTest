<font face="Arial">All versions of Weather Info have been permanently removed.  My reading of the weather.com EULA differs significantly from their lawyers' reading, and as a result, Weather Info will not be available in any form.  Their EULA definitions contain clauses that neither I, nor any other developer I know, could work with for a publicly available application.  I will be investigating using other data sources including the National Weather Service, EJSE.com, and Yahoo but any solution using these sources will not be available under the Weather Info name.  I will no longer be providing support for any versions of Weather Info that may have been downloaded and I ask you to uninstall and stop using any versions that you may have installed.  Continued use of Weather Info is no longer licensed for use in any form.</font>
