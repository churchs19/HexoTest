---
Last night, Andrea and I went to see the Cats 25th Anniversary Tour at the Buell Theater at the [Denver Center for the Performing Arts](http://www.dcpa.org).  The show was wonderful and we both really enjoyed what could be the last time Cats appears in Denver for a long time. 

Before the show, we also went and tried the new [Saltgrass Steakhouse](http://www.saltgrass.com/) over by my apartment.  I had been to the Saltgrass in Houston a number of years ago and the Westminster edition lived up to my memories from Houston.  The steaks were very good and were a good meal before the show.
