The Hebrew Talmud, the book where all of the sayings and preaching of rabbis are conserved over time, contains this quote:

"Be very careful if you make a woman cry, because God counts her tears.  The woman came out of a man's rib. Not from his feet to be walked on.  Not from his head to be superior, But from the side to be equal. Under the arm to be protected, and next to the heart to be loved."

I could not think of a more appropriate or poignant way to describe how I value all of the women in my life.
