![Our portrait by Clyde Steadman](/journal_images/mini-DSC03271-journal.jpg)

Today we had lunch with Suessy and Clyde at Capital Tea and picked up our new portrait.  Suessy commissioned Clyde to do our portrait for our wedding present.  We were both excited by the prospect and the final portrait is great!  The portrait is now hanging in our dining room and fits in great.  Clyde's art can be found at [Clyde Steadman Fine Art](http://www.clydesart.com/).
