Since I started working at the [Mine Safety and Health Administration](http://www.msha.gov) last May, I've noticed stuff like this.  Today, Microsoft's [Live.com](http://www.live.com) search portal had this really cool shot of workers in a coal mine.  It's interesting seeing this connection to my work featured in this way.  It's also worth noting that, despite the strides made by MSHA and the mining industry, it's still a very dangerous industry as there have already been four mining fatalities in the United States in 2009.
