<font face="Arial">Well repairs are finally underway, though I'm still not entirely comfortable with how things have been going.  Prestige claims to have done the frame pull, but has only provided me the "before" printout and not the "after" printout even though I have repeatedly asked for both.  After discussions with State Farm, I finally got Prestige to provide me with a full list of the planned repairs.  Right now it's looking like 2-3 more weeks until everything is done.</font>
