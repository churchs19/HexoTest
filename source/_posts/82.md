I have just released Four Corners 1.1.  The new version adds the ability to undo moves and also adds a reminder for the base card in the four corners.  This upgrade is available as a free upgrade for all registered users at [Handango](http://www.handango.com/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?productId=71524).  Version 1.1 is $5.50.  More information can be found on my [Software](projects.htm) page or at [Handango](http://www.handango.com/PlatformProductDetail.jsp?productId=71524).
