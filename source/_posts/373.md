Today marks the official beginning of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.  Andrea is working as a volunteer captain all week at one of the hotels in Lakewood, and last night we attended the Green Sunday kickoff concert at Red Rocks.  I've also already ran into one of the protests on the way to the Rockies game yesterday. 

It will continue to be interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out here in Denver, from the security theater that has made most of downtown inaccesible, to the overhyped protests, to the news from the Pepsi Center, and finally, Obama's acceptance speech at Invesco Field on Thursday night.  The DNC is in Denver for the first time in a century.  Let the party begin!
