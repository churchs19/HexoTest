This morning at 8:39 AM Mountain Time, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched in the first launch since the Columbia disaster.  It's good to see the space shuttles flying again as the first step to continung space exploration.  More coverage is on [NASA's Return to Flight page](http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/main/index.html?skipIntro=1).
