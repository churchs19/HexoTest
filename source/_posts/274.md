![Dinger celebrates the Rockies 3-1 win over the Evil Empire](/journal_images/mini-DSC00227-journal.jpg)

<font face="Arial">Last night I was lucky enough to go to my second Rockies game in 4 days.  Last Friday, Andrea and I joined my friend Lauren to watch the Rockies beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 12-2.  Then last night, Jeff and I went to watch the Rockies beat the New York Yankees 3-1.  Josh Fogg threw a masterpiece at the Yankees, giving up 1 run and 4 hits in seven innings.  The Yankees managed to make it interesting in the 8th versus Manny Corpas, but LaTroy Hawkins came in to induce an inning ending groundout with the bases loaded to preserve the lead.  The only ball the Yankees hit hard all night was Brian Fuentes' pitch to Hideki Matsui to lead off the ninth before Fuentes slammed the door to preserve the win. </font>

<font face="Arial">It was great to see Coors Field packed again as 48,000 people showed up to watch the Yankees come to town for the first time since 2002, and it was even better to watch the Rockies fans drown out the faux Yankees fans who invaded the ballpark.  The building was rocking as Fuentes recorded the final out in the ninth, giving the Rockies their biggest win of the season and putting them 2 games over .500 for the year.</font>
