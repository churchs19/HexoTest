---
Friday morning, Andrea and I got up early and drove up to Boulder in a light snow for the CU-Nebraska game.  It was only the fourth time that I've been to one in person.  The game was a great one as CU came out and took an early lead, but gave it back to Nebraska as they went to the break.  Neither team played anything resembling defense in the first half, but in the second half, CU intercepted the first 2 passes by Nebraska and blocked a punt on a 31-0 run.  The game was absolutely freezing with temperatures around 20 degrees for the whole game, but it was still a lot of fun as CU won 65-51, marking the first time I had ever seen CU beat Nebraska in person.
