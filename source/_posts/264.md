Stirling Weather is currently experiencing problems loading the extended forecast from the National Weather Service.  I am looking into the problems, but at this point it appears that the NWS web service server is not responding to requests.  I will update this as I learn more.

**Update** (_03/28/07 6:41AM)_**:** The National Weather Service appears to have corrected the problems with their web service.  The application should be working correctly now.
