I've just released Currency Converter 2005 v1.1.  Currency Converter 2005 v1.1 adds a button to the Get Rates tab to refresh all cached exchange rates.  This update also changes the logo at the bottom to help with some confusion that only the United States and Canada were supported.  Currency Converter 2005 supports all countries listed in the xmethods.net web service.  Download Currency Converter 2005 from my [Windows Mobile page](WindowsMobileSoftware.aspx).
