Yesterday afternoon, on my drive home from work, I crossed 100,000 miles in my 2001 BMW Z3.  I purchased it new in June 2001 from Gebhardt Automotive in Boulder with 8 miles on it.  It's definitely been a good car, and is running just as well today as the day I bought it.  Hopefully there's yet another 100,000 miles left to enjoy in it.
