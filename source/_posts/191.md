This past weekend, I went out to Buffalo for Andrea's last Barrister's Ball.  I flew out of Denver on Thursday night and got into Buffalo pretty late.  On Friday morning, we got up and drove to Seneca Falls, NY where we toured the [Women's Rights National Historical Park](http://www.nps.gov/wori/).  We went through the museum and then took guided tours through the Wesleyan Chapel, where the first Women's Rights Convention was held, and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton house.  Following that we drove down Cayuga Lake to Ithaca, stopping at a few wineries on the way.  The Finger Lakes wineries have all proved to be be pretty disappointing on the quality scale.  Near Ithaca, we also stopped at Taughannock Falls and Ithaca Falls before heading back to Buffalo.

On Saturday, we got up and drove up to Niagara-on-the-Lake in Canada.  We stopped at the [Frogpond Farm winery](http://www.frogpondfarm.ca/main.html) before going into town.  In town we wandered around for a while, browsing some of the shops and also had lunch.  After lunch, we went out to the shore of Lake Ontario before visiting [Palatine Hills](http://www.palatinehillsestatewinery.com/), [Coyote's Run](http://www.coyotesrunwinery.com/), and [Chateau des Charmes](http://www.chateaudescharmes.com/).  Following that we stopped at [Brock's Monument](http://www.friendsoffortgeorge.ca/bm.htm), which is a monument to the Major-General Sir Issac Brock who died during the defense of Queenston Heights from the Americans in the War of 1812, before heading back to Buffalo for the ball.

The Barrister's Ball was held at the Statler Towers again and featured the exact same meal as last year.  The food was ok and we had a good time dancing and hanging out with Andrea's friends.  Sunday, we woke up, had breakfast burritos, and just hung out until it was time to head home again.
