<font face="Arial">Yesterday, Andrea, Janice, and Margie swam, biked, and ran respectively in the 2007 Tri For The Cure down at Cherry Creek Reservoir.  They did a great job as a group, coming in in 1 hour, 42 minutes, and 31 seconds for the full time and placing right in the middle of their class and doing much better than any of them individually expected to do.  [Their full results are available here](http://downingevents.com/data/Results07list.php?x_BIB=2727&z_BIB=%3D%2C%2C).  More articles about the race are online in the [Denver Post](http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6552325?source=rss) and the [Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5660668,00.html).</font>
