Today's New York Times has an [article on the new wing of the Denver Art Museum](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/arts/design/12libe.html?ex=1318305600&en=4cfd50aadad3722c&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) that we visited on Sunday.  The author clearly did not like the building and was highly critical of Liebiskind's work.  While I do agree with some of the author's assertions, I don't agree with his overall conclusion that the building doesn't work.  The structure is clearly designed to be somewhat disorienting, but I think the galleries work well for the most part.  There was always something unexpected around every corner, and the building adds another piece of interesting architecture to the Denver skyline.
