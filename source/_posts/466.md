Pac-12 Champions!  How good does that sound!?!  CU beat Arizona 53-51 for the first Pac-12 basketball championship this weekend and I watched it on TV with Andrea and Ethan. It was so great that Ethan was saying “Go Buffs!��� and pointing to the CU logos on both of our shirts and saying “Buffaloes.”  I’ve got a future Buff on my hands.  It was a great game and now we’ll be playing UNLV in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Thursday in Albuquerque, NM at The Pit.  My dad will be going to the game and rooting on the Buffs.

Go Buffs!
