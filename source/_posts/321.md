This past Sunday, December 16th, was Grandpa Ideker's 80th birthday.  On Saturday, Andrea and I surprised him with an angel food cake (his favorite) at the 8 am men's bible study at church.  He was so surprised and had to relay the story of a week earlier when I called to ask him about his favorite cake.  When I called and asked, he said "angel food," and I relayed that to Andrea who said "Can't he pick something easier?"  Grandpa heard that and said that a chocolate cake would be great but he was still amuzed by Andrea's reaction.

Then at noon, my mom went over to Grandma and Grandpa's place to surprise him since he didn't know that she was coming in.  From what I heard, Grandpa didn't even recognize her at first look since he had successful cataract surgery last Monday.  They hung out for the rest of the day and then she brought Grandma and Grandpa up to Doug's house.

All of the rest of us were waiting at Doug's house for them.  Grandpa didn't know that Ronnie, Heather, Daniel, and Jason had flown in for the weekend for this as well.  As he came down the stairs, he saw Ronnie and Heather and says "This isn't fair, this isn't fair," as he realized the surprise that we had thrown for him.  During the course of the party, all of his kids and grandkids, including me, read a small tribute to him that each of us had written. 

The next morning, we had everyone over for brunch for Grandpa's real birthday and for Christmas since everyone was in town.  It was a great weekend.
