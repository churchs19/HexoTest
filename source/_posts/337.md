---
Last night I met my friend, John, up in Boulder to watch CU take on Villanova in the third round of the WNIT.  Coming into the game, Villanova was one of the best 3-point shooting teams in NCAA Women's history, and they showed it right off the bat, hitting their first two to go up 6-0.  It was quickly 9-2 and Villanova had their working margin for most of the night.  CU got down by as many as 11 in the first half, but cut the lead to 7 at the break. 

In the 2nd half, we never really made a run, and Villanova kept the lead between 7 and 11 points.  With just about 4 and a half minutes to go, Villanova led by 11, and we were commenting that someone other than Jackie McFarland needed to make a shot at some point for CU.  That's when Brittany Spears (no, not that Brittany Spears), decided to show up.  She knocked down a pair of threes and the comeback was on.

From that point, CU outscored Villanova 20-3, and took our first lead with just over a minute to play.  CU then knocked down some free throws and won 64-58 in the most amazing game I've seen in a long time.  Now CU goes on to play TCU in Boulder on Sunday in the WNIT quarterfinals.  Go Buffs!
