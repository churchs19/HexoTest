This past Sunday, May 3rd, Lauren and I ran in the 2009 Colorado Rockies Home Run for the Homeless 5K.  The race started at 8:15 am and I did pretty well through the first mile but right after the first mile marker, both of my quads started cramping.  I walked for a while and, after stretching them out ran some more too.  I walked most of the middle mile and a half before running around the warning track at Coors Field and to the finish line.  I'm betting my time this year will be about the same as last year (which wasn't very good).  After the run, we hung out in the bleachers in left field and enjoyed the free food and watched the prize drawing before heading home.  It was a good time and I definitely plan on going again.

My next 5K will be on May 16th for the [Access2Justice - Sean May Memorial Run](http://www.finishlinetiming.com/races/Access2Justice/index.html) at Barr Lake that Andrea is helping organize.
