Over the 4th of July weekend, Andrea and I went to Des Moines for her dad's 50th birthday.  The weather really didn't cooperate as it rained for significant portions of every day.  It was still a fun trip though since we went to the Des Moines Symphony concert, the Farmer's Market, and had her dad's birthday party.  It was definitely a quick weekend trip though.

Last weekend my friend Julia got married.  It was a beautiful ceremony at the Embassy Suites in downtown Denver.  Congratulations Julia and Tristan!
