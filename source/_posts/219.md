Continuing the story of the wedding week and honeymoon, I now get to August 18, 2006, the day of the wedding.  I got up early in the morning because I had to go to the tux store to pick up my new pants and Andrea's dad's new jacket. 

After picking the fixed tuxes up, I went back to the Savery where I met Heather, Daniel, and Pastor Mike in the lobby to go to the Iowa State Fair.  We then jumped in the car to go pick up Greg on the way to the fair.  After getting no response from Greg after a number of tries, we gave up and headed up to the fair without him.  Once we got to the fair, we headed straight to the agriculture building to see the famous butter cow.  This year, the three butter sculptures were Superman, Mr. State Fair (Bill Riley), and Jersey, the butter cow.  The cow is carved out of about 3200 pounds of pure butter. 

Following the butter cow, we went and grabbed lunch and Pastor Mike and Daniel began a competition to see how many snow cones they could eat.  Next we went into the art building and wandered around until Greg called for us to meet him.  Greg and I both got the fried oreos for dessert and Pastor Mike had a fried hoho.  We then went to look at all of the livestock and then passed by the butter cow again on our way out so that Greg could get to see it. 

At that point, it was time to head back to the hotel to get ready for the ceremony.  During the 4 and a half hours I was there, I had about 5 people stop me because they liked the shirt I was wearing and had to get a picture of it!
