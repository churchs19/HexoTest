This past weekend, Andrea and I went down to New Mexico to visit my dad.  We left Denver on Thursday night but 7 hours later had only made it to Walsenburg because of the first real snow storm of the season, so we got a hotel room and spent the night in Walsenburg. 

Friday morning we got up, had breakfast and then continued our trek to the south.  We stopped and took a few pictures of the Spanish Peaks area with the fresh snow and morning sun.  We then continued south, stopping at Orlando's ([as featured on Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_bf/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9950_20939,00.html)) in Taos for lunch.  We then continued into the Rio Grande Gorge, stopping at [Vivác](http://www.vivacwinery.com/), [La Chiripada](http://www.lachiripada.com/), and [Black Mesa](http://www.blackmesawinery.com/) wineries before heading up the hill to Los Alamos.  We then went back down to dinner at [Rancho de Chimayo](http://www.ranchodechimayo.com/) to finish the day.

Saturday morning, my dad went and got us breakfast burritos from Chili Works in Los Alamos.  We then met my friends, Scott and Marianne, for lunch at The Hill Diner.  We then went back to my dad's house before heading down to Albuquerque.  We picked up my brother in Albuquerque and then went to [Sadie's](http://www.sadiessalsa.com/) for dinner since we had to hit all of our favorite New Mexican restaurants.  After dinner we went do [The Pit at UNM](http://golobos.collegesports.com/facilities/nm-the-pit.html) to watch UNM defeat Air Force 62-59.

Sunday we woke up and hung out with my family before we headed out of town.  On our way out of Los Alamos, we went down to White Rock to Scott and Marianne's house to meet their new baby, Adrianna.  We then headed back to Denver, listening to the Broncos debacle on the radio the whole way.
