I've just released Weather Info System Tray 1.3.  Weather Info System Tray 1.3 contains a number of bug fixes as well as the addition of a 5 day extended forecast. This update fixes issues where the application would continue to pop up message boxes when the network was unavailable, and an unhandled exception if the network was unavailable when the Update menu item was clicked. Version 1.3 also adds the a five day extended forecast and a menu item to update the weather data in the context menu of the main application.

To install the update, exit any running instances of Weather Info System Tray by right clicking on the icon in the system tray and clicking exit.  Then run the installer to update the application.  Download Weather Info System Tray 1.3 [here](OtherProjects.aspx).
