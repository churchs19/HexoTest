Today is a big day here, where I work as a contractor for Visa ([V](http://moneycentral.msn.com/detail/stock_quote?Symbol=V)).  Visa debuted today with the largest IPO in history at approximately $17.9 billion or $44/share.  Coming into work, we were greeted at the entrance with a huge sign, much like the image on this post, reading "NYSE Takes Visa."  There was also a big screen set up in the cafeteria with live news from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and a free continental breakfast.  Later today there will also be an ice cream social for everyone here.  Andrea and I managed to get a few shares earlier this morning and it's up a few dollars from where we bought in at, and I think it's a pretty good growth stock going forward.  All in all it's shaping up as a pretty exciting day here.
