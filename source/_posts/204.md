It's been quite a while since I posted, so a quick update is in order.  Andrea moved in on the first weekend of June and we've been very busy ever since.  Softball is going full tilt now with all three leagues in play and Andrea is busily studying for the bar.  The wedding planning is coming along and invitations will be going out this week.  We finally got our reservations confirmed for our first 8 days in Italy and we will be staying at the [Greppi di Silli](http://www.igreppidisilli.it) agriturismo outside of Florence for our first week.

Finally, one random side note from the theater of the bizarre department: After the first one-hitter in Rockies history last night, [Coors Field is tied for first in the major leagues with seven shutouts this season](http://www.denverpost.com/ci_3961497?source=rss).
