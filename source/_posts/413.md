---
In a scene that I can imagine was replicated in offices around the country this morning, my coworkers and I gathered around my computer to watch the Inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States of America. We watched Obama take the oath of office and deliver a speech that was filled with equal parts realism and hope in the better side of America; a speech that will be remembered as one of the best Inaugural Addresses in American history. It made this moment in history that much more powerful to be surrounded by others in this communal celebration of the American spirit. On this day, I can truly say, "Godspeed, Mr. President!"
