Well I completed my move to my new apartment this past Saturday. It's a much nicer place than my old one, not to mention a lot more convenient for work. My commute now is only about 10 mins as opposed to the ~1 hour drive I had before. Luckily we got the move completed before the snow really started to fly in earnest.

Thanks again to Dave, Margie, Dan, Margaret, Greg, Jenn, and Mike for helping me move!
