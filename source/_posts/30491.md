It’s been a while since I posted here, but as a quick update, I was let go by EffectiveUI in mid-July. After a brief job search, I’m now at [ShopAtHome.com](http://www.shopathome.com) where I’m a Sr. Software Engineer on the Browser App team. I’m working on building the browser extensions and their supporting services. I’ve been here for about two weeks and it’s been a really good change so far and I’m looking forward to getting even deeper into the application and seeing some of my work pushed out in public releases soon.
