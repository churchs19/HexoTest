Yesterday, in our much delayed tournament finale, the Holy Shepherd Men defeated St. Phillip twice, 15-8 and 8-4, to win the Lutheran Men's Softball League title.  Both games were punctuated with great defense and timely hitting.  We set the tone on the very first pitch when the first game resumed with St. Phillip having runners on first and second with nobody out.  A fly went to Chris in left field and after the catch he caught the runner on second off the base for a quick double play and we were rolling.  The second game was tight all of the way and with a 7-4 lead and only a few minutes left on the clock, the bottom of the batting order got a number of timely hits to score an insurance run and run out the clock, clinching Holy Shepherd's first Lutheran Men's Softball League title since 1983.
