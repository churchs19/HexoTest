![Colorado Avalanche 10th Anniversary](/journal_images/Avs10th.gif) Hockey's finally back!  The lockout is over and it's time to get back to playing games that matter.  Tonight at 8 PM Mountain, the [Colorado Avalanche](http://www.coloradoavalanche.com) will drop the puck on their 10th season in Denver versus the Edmonton Oilers.  It will be interesting to see if the supposed crackdown on obstruction continues.  I, for one, won't be convinced until I see them call the penalties in the final minute of a playoff game, but for now it's time to enjoy hockey again.  Go Avs!
