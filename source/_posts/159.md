<font face="Arial">This past weekend was a busy one.  Friday night I went dancing at the [Turnverein](http://www.denverturnverein.org/) like I do every week and then went to see the late showing of Chronicles of Narnia with a bunch of friends.  The movie was ok, but not great.  While it was very faithful to the novel, I ended up being a little disappointed in the overall presentation. </font>

<font face="Arial">Saturday night was the [TimeCentre](http://www.timecentre.com/) holiday party at the [Omni Interlocken Golf Course](http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/DenverInterlocken.aspx) clubhouse.  The food was phenomenal and the entertainment, comedian [Todd Johnson](http://www.toddjohnson.biz/), was good as well.</font>

<font face="Arial">Sunday I had to get up early to go to Green Mountain Presbyterian Church where I was helping my friend Katie play bells in their Christmas cantata.  We rehearsed for about 2 hours before the service and the whole performance went well.  After the cantata, I went down to Larimer Square where I played in the annual [TubaChristmas](http://www.tubachristmas.com/) concert.  There were about 325 tubas and euphoniums playing Christmas carols in the concert.  Following the concert I went out to lunch/dinner with some friends from the concert at [Sam's No. 3](http://www.samsno3.com/) before heading home for the night.</font>

<font face="Arial">All in all it was a good weekend and a very busy one as well.</font>
