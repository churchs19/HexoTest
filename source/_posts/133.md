<font face="Arial">Today is my last day at CH2M Hill and Rocky Flats.  I will be spending the day completing final checkout from Rocky Flats and having lunch with the [KAMS](http://www.kaiseranalytical.com) group that I have supported for the last 7 years.  I started out at Rocky Flats back in February of 1998 as an intern while I was studying at CU, and then was hired on full time by RTS Enabling Technology when I graduated.  When [CH2M Hill](http://www.ch2m.com) hired me in November of 2003, I was the 5th longest tenured employee at RTS Enabling Technology.  During my time at the Flats, I have grown considerably as a person and as a professional software engineer and I would like to thank everyone I have worked with at CH2M Hill, RTS Enabling Technology, and Rocky Flats for all of the good times working on the closure of Rocky Flats and all of the opportunities that have been presented to me.</font>
