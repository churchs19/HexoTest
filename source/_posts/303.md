<font face="Arial">The Rockies beat the Phillies today 4-2 in Game 1 of the NLDS for the second playoff win in franchise history!  The win was the Rockies' 15th in the last 16 games as the Rockies made a 3 run 2nd stand up for the next 7 innings behind a masterful pitching performance by Jeff Francis.  Game 2 is tomorrow at 1 pm Mountain in Philly. </font>
