![Z3 Repairs in Progress](/photo/z3/RepairPanorama.jpg) Repairs seem to be progressing at this point.  Prestige is having problems with their frame machine and may have to send my car out for an independent measurement if they can't get it fixed since they neglected to do the "after" printout that had been requested numerous times.  The paint work has been done, but they're still waiting on a couple of parts.  There's also some remaining gap issues (see the bottom right image) that still need fixed.  I've been frustrated by the lack of communication by both Prestige and State Farm, but hopefully I will get my car back in the next week or two.
