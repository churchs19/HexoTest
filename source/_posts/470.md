Since my article in [MSDN Magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/), “[Develop Hybrid Native and Mobile Web Apps](http://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/hh852592),” came out, I’ve received a lot of questions on how to decide what kind of mobile application to build: mobile web, hybrid, or native mobile? This is a really thorny question and one that doesn’t have a well-defined answer. I’ve spent a lot of time over the past week discussing how to go about answering this question with some of the members of the sales team at [EffectiveUI](http://www.effectiveui.com) and I’d like to share some of my process in the hope that it will help others with these decisions and spark a conversation to continue to refine the decision-making process.

I’ve just had a [new post published on the EffectiveUI blog](http://blog.effectiveui.com/?p=8514) about these thoughts and I’d love to hear what you think.
