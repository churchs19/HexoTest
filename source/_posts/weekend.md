This past weekend was a good weekend.  On Saturday, John and I went to the CU - New Mexico State game and watched the Buffs stomp on NMSU 39-0.  They had a halftime fireworks show that was ok, but nothing terribly impressive as well.

On Sunday, I played in my church softball team's end of the year tournament.  We went in as the #2 seed, but lost our first game two weeks ago to Hosanna 8-5 and had to work our way through the losers' bracket.  On Sunday, we beat #5 seed Concordia 9-8, #4 seed Our Father 26-8, and then #3 seed Hosanna 12-8 to advance to the championship game.  It was the first trip to the championship game for Holy Shepherd in over 20 years.  The championship was tied at 3 in the second inning at about 8:30 pm when the power went out, so the game will hopefully be made up in two weeks.
