<font face="Arial">This past weekend Andrea was out here visiting for Valentine's.  On Friday we went to lunch with my sister who was back from New Jersey and then Friday night we went out with a bunch of my friends at Big Bill's NY Pizza before going to a Balboa lesson and dancing at the Turnverein. </font>

<font face="Arial">Saturday we spent almost the entire day at the Turnverein for the dance workshops.  We learned a lot and had a lot of fun.  For lunch we went to [Chedd's](http://www.chedds.com/) in Denver which is a very highly rated gourmet grilled cheese restaurant.  For dinner I made gnocchi in a sage apple cider butter sauce which was very good too.  After dinner we went back to the Turnverein for a night of dancing.</font>

<font face="Arial">Sunday we were pretty lazy but we did go to [Bed Bath & Beyond](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?order_num=-1&wrn=%2D482327593) to begin our [wedding registry](http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?order_num=-1&wrn=%2D482327593).  After that we went over to my mom's to hang out with my mom, stepdad, grandparents, and sister since Heather's flight back to Newark had been cancelled.  After that we went and had a wonderful Valentine's dinner at the [Melting Pot](http://www.fonduecity.com).</font>

<font face="Arial">Monday morning was an early morning as we had to have Andrea at DIA by 7:45am.  She ended up getting bumped from her original flight but managed to get a free round trip ticket from United for getting into Buffalo a whole 2 and a half hours later than originally scheduled.</font>
