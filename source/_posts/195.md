Today the Rocky Mountain News is running an article on the 90th Anniversary of [Bandelier National Monument](http://www.nps.gov/band/).  Growing up in Los Alamos, we spent a lot of time in Bandelier, camping, having picnics, hiking, and touring the ruins.  Bandelier was designated as a National Monument on February 11, 1916, predating the town of Los Alamos by almost 40 years.  The main visitor area at Bandelier was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and was designated as a CCC Historic District in 1987.  The Rocky Mountain News article talks about some of the 90th Anniversary events that are planned for the rest of the year in addition to talking about the history of the Monument.  Read the rest of the article on the [Rocky Mountain News](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4629634,00.html).
