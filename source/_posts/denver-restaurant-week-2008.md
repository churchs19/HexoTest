This past week, Andrea and I went to a number of restaurants for [Denver Restaurant Week](http://www.denverrestaurantweek.com).  The week is highlighted by 3-4 course meals at hundreds of Denver's best restaurants for $52.80 for 2 people. 

On Tuesday, we went to [Samba Room](http://www.sambaroom.net/) on Larimer Square.  Samba Room is a latin fusion restaurant with a Cuban and Brazilian bent.  I had the South American Pumpkin Soup, Grilled Hanger Steak with Rosemary-Honey Adobo over Black Beans & Pickled Jalapeno, and Tres Leches cake for dessert.  Andrea had the Latin Caesar Salad, Oven Roasted Orange-Coriander Marinated Half Chicken, and the Guava Banana Empanada.  It was definitely an excellent meal.

On Wednesday, we went to [The Briarwood Inn](http://www.thebriarwoodinn.com/) with Dave and Margie from church.  We all enjoyed the appetizer tray of crackers, fresh shrimp cocktail, chicken liver pate, smoked salmon butter, and cheddar cheese spread and then we all had the house spinach salad.  For the main course, Dave and I had prime rib, Andrea had the Chicken Rochambeau, and Margie had the Tilapia.  We finished with their dessert tray of fresh fruit and a number of different sweets.  This was definitely the best meal of the week.

Finally, we went to the [Palm Restaurant](http://www.thepalm.com/) in the Westin downtown on Thursday night with some of Andrea's friends from the Colorado Women's Bar Association.  This was another excellent meal as we led off with arugula and endive salad, then I had the Steak Oscar and Andrea had the Chicken Scallopine Medici.  For dessert, I had the New York Cheesecake and Andrea had the Chocolate Indulgence cake.

All of the meals this year were wonderful, and we both look forward to next year's Denver Restaurant Week.
