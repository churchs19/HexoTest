Over the past few months, I've been contributing to an open source Chrome extension, [FullyFeedly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullyfeedly/ikdncbjpcpkheefmnbicggciklkeebmp) on [GitHub](https://github.com/Muffo/fullyfeedly). It's an extension I use every day to view the full content of my [Feedly](https://feedly.com) feeds inline instead of having to constantly open new tabs. 

It's been a pleasure to work with [Andrea Grandi](http://muffo.it/) to improve this great extension. It's allowed me to keep my Chrome extension knowledge up to date and to contribute back to the community at the same time.
