This past Saturday, Andrea and I went up to Boulder for CU Homecoming.  We got to CU right at 11 am for check in for the 2008 Alumni Band and were stunned by the line.  There ended up being 189 playing alumns this year, doubling the previous high. 

The reason for the big increase in attendance is that this year marked the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [University of Colorado Marching Band](http://bands.colorado.edu/marching).  To celebrate the anniversary, a number of former directors were back, including Gary Hill, Wayne Bailey, Tom Caneva (my first director), and Rob Carnahan (my 2nd director).  Each of these former directors also led the band during rehearsal and for one song during the pregame or halftime shows.  We also had appearances by the Voice of Folsom Field, Al Cass, and CU-Boulder Chancellor, Bud Peterson, during the course of the day. 

After rehearsals as an alumni band and then with the CU band, we had lunch in the band room.  Lunch was highlighted by a slideshow by CU Marching Band Historian, Walt Blankenship, of moments from the history of the CU Marching Band.  It was truly amazing seeing all of the photos that he had managed to collect from the entire 100 year history.

After lunch, we formed up with the CU Band for the parade to Folsom and the game against Texas.  The game was a disappointment as CU was quickly down 7-0 on a flukey play by Texas QB, Colt McCoy, and never recovered, losing 38-14.  The halftime show was a lot of fun though as the band played tunes from the 100 years of CU Marching Band, finishing with the 2008 Alumni Band joining them for "Celebration", the "CU Alma Mater," and the "CU Fight Song." 

It was a great time this year with the big turnout.  I was able to reconnect with a number friends that I hadn't seen in years.  Congratulations to the University of Colorado "Golden Buffalo" Marching Band on 100 years and here's to a great 2nd century.
