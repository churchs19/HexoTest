I turned on [Stirling Weather](http://www.s-church.net/Windows.aspx?ID=0) this morning and saw a forecast that I've never seen before out of the National Weather Service's National Digital Forecast Database: 100% probability of a blizzard.Â  Right now we're on track to get our biggest snow of the season and they're calling for 8-16 inches of snow today in Denver.
