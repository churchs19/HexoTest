Brrrrrr!  We woke up this morning to a temperature of -17° F here in Denver with a wind chill of -36° F.   Last night set a new record low of -18° F officially.  The previous record was -6° F, set in 1951.  Frost was climbing up pretty much all of the windows in our house and the solarium windows were completely frosted over.  The picture below is the windows in our kitchen this morning.

All I have to say is, "Brrrrrr!"
