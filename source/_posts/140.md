Even though I have moved on from Rocky Flats, I have continued to watch the news about the closure project as it approaches completion.  Today, the Boulder Daily Camera ran an article detailing the remaining items of the cleanup and the details of the final closure of the site.  I can see the progress as I look out from my new office window across the plain leading to the Flats.  I can now see all the way to the mountains where the Rocky Flats industrial area once stood.  In approximately one month, the Department of Energy and Kaiser-Hill will declare physical completion of the cleanup and begin the process of transferring the site to the Fish and Wildlife Service for the creation of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge marking the end of an era for the Denver area.  Read the article online at the [Boulder Daily Camera](http://dailycamera.com/bdc/county_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2423_4094271,00.html).
