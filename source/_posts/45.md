I'm in Buffalo right now sitting in Andrea's Constitutional Law class. Now I know I'm not cut out to be a lawyer. ;) It's amazing how they can consistently take something simple and make it complex. Anyway, tonight we're going to the "Bar & Bench Night" and then going to the Buffalo Sabres game vs. the Pittsburgh Penguins which will be my first NHL game outside of Denver.
