---
Today is my Grandma Ideker's 84th birthday.  Tonight we will be going out to [Abrusci's Italian Restaurant](http://www.abruscis.com/) in Wheat Ridge to celebrate with her.

On a related note, it has been a busy couple of weeks.  Two weeks ago my grandpa went in the hospital.  Fortunately he's doing much better now and was released after about five days.  As a result though, Grandma and Grandpa have decided that they will be moving into the [Meridian](http://www.meridians.com) independent living home near their house near the end of the month.  Shortly after that, Andrea and I will be moving into their house where we will be renting from them for the time being.  We will be helping them go through all of their stuff as we move in and will also be doing a bunch of the deferred maintenance on the house.  It's a really nice house and it will be great to get out of apartments and into a real house.

Happy Birthday Grandma!
