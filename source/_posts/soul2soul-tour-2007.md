---
Tuesday night, Andrea and I went to see Tim McGraw and Faith Hill in concert down at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  The show was my first real arena concert.  We ended up sitting way up in the corner in the 3rd level of the Pepsi Center but the show was still a lot of fun.  Tim McGraw was clearly the better performer of the two.  We both enjoyed the show a lot and it was definitely a good way to spend the evening.
