![NLCS Here We Come!  Go Rockies!](/journal_images/DSC01623-journal.jpg)

<font face="Arial">Tonight, in the first playoff game in Denver since 1995, the Rockies beat the Phillies 2-1 to complete the three game sweep of the NL Division Series.  It was another tense game as the Rockies took the lead in the 5th inning only to have the Phillies tie it up in the top of the 7th.  Ubaldo Jimenez pitched brilliantly for the Rockies, allowing just 3 hits in 6 1/3 innings of work.  Jeff Baker came through with the biggest hit of the night, singling in Yorvit Torrealba for the winning run in the bottom of the 8th. </font>

<font face="Arial">Next up for the Rockies: A wild west showdown with the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS.  Games 1 and 2 are Thursday and Friday in Arizona.  The first NLCS game ever held in Denver will be on Sunday, October 14 and Andrea and I will be there.</font>
