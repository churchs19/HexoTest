Last night, Daniel and I went to the 2005 Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Championship at the Pepsi Center to watch UNM and Utah. After a phenomenal basketball game, UNM won 60-56 and we got to celebrate a championship sweep by the UNM men's and women's teams. The Pepsi Center was rocking and was as close to a UNM home game as you will ever see in a conference tournament and the best part is the Lobos are going dancing! To quote the [Denver Post](http://www.denverpost.com/Stories/0,1413,36~87~2760370,00.html#), "The Mountain West Conference Tournament moved from Las Vegas to Denver a year ago primarily to provide a neutral court. The predominantly New Mexico crowd of 10,628 was anything but neutral and proved Lobos fans don't have to be in The Pit to be loud."Â  Check out the photos in the [photo album](/photo.aspx).
