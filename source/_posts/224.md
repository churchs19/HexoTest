<font face="Arial">On Saturday, Andrea and I got up early and drove up to Boulder so I could be in the 2006 ["Silver Buffalo" Alumni Band](http://www.cumarchingalumni.com/).  Registration started at 8 along with breakfast and socializing.  The alumni then rehearsed by ourselves for an hour and then went and rehearsed our part of the halftime show with the current band.  We then returned to the band room for lunch and a "State of the CU Bands" update by the Director of Bands, Dr. Allan McMurray.</font>

<font face="Arial">After lunch, we met up with the current band again for warm ups and then paraded over to the stadium for the game against Baylor.  The game was a true heartbreaker as CU lost 34-31 to fall to 0-6 on the year.  CU was poised to win in the third overtime, having held Baylor to a field goal, when Bernard Jackson threw an interception in the end zone, ending the game.</font>

<font face="Arial">After the game, we went to the [Dark Horse](http://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&lr=&q=dark+horse&near=Boulder,+CO&radius=0.0&latlng=40015000,-105270000,16922372803928291853&sa=X&oi=local&ct=authority) for dinner and drinks with a bunch of my friends to drown our sorrows after the disappointing loss.  It was good to go back for homecoming since I hadn't been to a homecoming in 3 years now and I was glad that Andrea got to go to share it this year.</font>
