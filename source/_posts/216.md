I'm finally working at my first client for Fujitsu now.  I started on Monday at Visa in Highlands Ranch.  Thus far, I haven't done much because they're still slowly working on getting me access to all of the systems I need. 

In the small world category, within the first 10 minutes I was at Visa, I ran into a friend from church in jr. high and high school that I hadn't seen since then.  She's the facilities coordinator here, and we're going to go have lunch tomorrow to catch up.
