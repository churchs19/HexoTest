<font face="Arial">I've just released iTunes Playlist Converter 1.0.  The iTunes Playlist converter takes iTunes XML playlists and and converts them to a PLS format that can be used on any other media player. The wizard also contains the option to do string replacement in the paths for replacing local paths with network share paths.  Download iTunes Playlist Converter 1.0 from my [Windows Software page](WindowsSoftware.aspx).</font>
