Yesterday was the primary election here in Colorado.  Turnout appeared to be particularly dismal as usual.  When I showed up to vote at 12:30, I was the second Democrat and seventh voter overall at my precinct.  Admittedly, there were no contested races, so there wasn't much incentive to go vote, but it's still pretty sad nonetheless.

After voting, I continued running a bunch of errands for the wedding.  It was a nice day, so I walked to all of the errands and, looking at the map, I figure I walked somewhere between eight and nine miles yesterday.  I'm definitely enjoying the time off right now where I can afford to take three hours to run my errands instead of being rushed everywhere.
