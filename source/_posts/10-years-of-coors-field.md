Ten years ago today, on April 26th, 1995, the Rockies christened Coors Field in dramatic fashion with 14th inning, 2 run home run off the bat of Dante Bichette to beat the New York Mets 11-9, and that was just a precusor to the fireworks that were to come.  I have had the privilege of watching hundreds of games in baseball's most exciting ballpark, including the first snow-out, Opening Days (1996-2000 & 2005), and the [1998 All-Star Game](http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/history/mlb_asgrecaps_story_headline.jsp?story_page=recap_1998).  While the Rockies have been consistently mediocre over their 13 year history, Coors Field is easily the best venue I've ever been in to watch a baseball game.  To quote Dan Lucero from [Up In The Rockies](http://rockies.mostvaluablenetwork.com/index.php?p=88), "I wouldn’t trade our jewel in LoDo for all the “winning” ballparks in the league."  Photos from my many trips to Coors Field are in the [Rockies section](/PhotoAlbum.aspx?ID=ROX) of my [photo page](Photo.aspx).
