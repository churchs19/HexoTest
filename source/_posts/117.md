I've recently wanted a spyware free utility to show the current weather along with any current watches and warnings on the taskbar of my PC. This new application uses the same core as Weather Info below for the Pocket PC to get weather information from weather.com®. Additionally the Weather Info System Tray also displays current watches and warnings from the National Weather Service based on either a state level or an NWS Zone Code ([click here to find your zone code](http://weather.gov/alerts/)). The watches and warnings feature only works for areas covered by the National Weather Service while the rest of the weather data works for any location covered by weather.com®.  Weather Info System Tray 1.2 can be dowloaded from my [Other Projects page](OtherProjects.aspx).
