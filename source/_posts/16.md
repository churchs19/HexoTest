I've just released my second PocketPC game; another classick solitaire game, Clock Solitaire. Clock Solitaire is a fun and addictive solitaire game where all of the cards are dealt into 13 piles of 4 cards each. Twelve of the piles are arranged in the pattern of a clock, with the thirteenth pile in the center. The top card of the center pile is turned up to start the game.To play a card, place it on the pile that represents its value on the clock face. Kings are played on the center pile. Once a card is played on its correct pile, the top card of that pile is turned over. Play continues by placing the new card on its proper pile. The game ends when all 52 cards have been correctly placed, or all four Kings have been played. If all 52 cards were correctly placed, the game will continue to a new round with your score carrying over. For more information, check out my [projects page](projects.htm).
