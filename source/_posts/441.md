![Tu-lo Git 2 Quit](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/WindowsLiveWriter/Whatadifferenceamonthmakes_8B00/IMG_7576.jpg "Tu-lo Git 2 Quit") Just under a month ago, the Rockies fired Clint Hurdle as their manager, and [I advocated](http://www.s-church.net/Blog.aspx?ID=438) making a lot of trades to retool a team that was playing so poorly that the sum was clearly less than the individual parts.  Well what a difference a month makes!  Ever since firing Hurdle, the Rockies turned into the team I thought they were at the beginning of the season.  Some of the major highlights:

*   19-5 under Jim Tracy, the best start by an in-season replacement manager in MLB history.
*   Franchise record 9 game road winning streak going into tonight's game versus the Angels.
*   Already set a new franchise record for wins in the month of June with 7 games remaining in the month.
*   Tied the longest winning streak in franchise history at 11 wins, matching the streak that got us into the playoffs in September 2007\.
*   Currently on a streak of 17 wins in 18 games, sweeping the Cardinals, Brewers, Mariners, and Pirates in the process and taking 2 of 3 from the defending American League Champion Tampa Bay Rays  in the process.
*   Rockies have moved from last place in the NL West, 14 games back, to 3rd place, 9 games back, and have moved from the 2nd worst record in the National League to being 0.5 games behind San Francisco and Milwaukee for the NL Wild Card.
*   The Rockies went from the 2nd worst record in MLB at 18-28 to tied for the 4th most wins in the National League at 37-33\.

I would have never thought that just making a managerial change would change this team this much.  I thought there was more than enough talent on this team to be a contender, but for some reason it never materialized in the first two months.  But boy are they on a run now.

It is great fun to be a Rockies fan right now!  **<font color="#400080" size="3">Go Rockies!</font>**
