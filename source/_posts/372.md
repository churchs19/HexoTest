My anniversary present from Andrea was [this beautiful painting](/ViewPhoto.aspx?ID=5715&LINK_ID=2NDANNIVERSARY&PAGE=0) by [Clyde Steadman](http://www.clydesart.com/).  It was based on a [photo I had taken at Coors Field in September 2003](/ViewPhoto.aspx?ID=773&LINK_ID=ROX&PAGE=7).  The painting will be the centerpiece of my sports room once we get that set up but, for now, it is hanging above the TV in our living room.  Clyde even customized it by putting my name in the painting as the name of the batter on the scoreboard.  Thanks Andrea!
