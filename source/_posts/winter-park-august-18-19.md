After arriving back in Denver, we headed up to Winter Park and Fraser where we spent the weekend in Larry and Shirley's condo.  We slept until just after noon on Saturday, and then got up and went and grabbed lunch at DeAntonio's Pizza.  We then went into Winter Park and did some wine tasting at [Verso Cellars](http://www.versocellars.com/index.htm).  We then wandered around Winter Park for a while before heading back to the condo to relax. 

We headed back into Winter Park at about 7:30 for our anniversary dinner at [Gasthaus Eichler](http://gasthauseichler.com/restaurant.html).  The food was wonderful and made for a great anniversary dinner.  After dinner, we headed back to the condo and relaxed in the hot tub with a glass of Peller Estates' Ice Cuvee before heading to bed.

On Sunday, we slept in again and the got up and went to have breakfast at the [Mountain Rose Cafe](http://www.mountainrosecafe.com/) in Winter Park.  We then went back and cleaned up the condo.  After cleaning the condo, we waited out a brief thunderstorm to ride the Winter Park Alpine Slide, which is the longest alpine slide in North America, before heading back down to Denver to finish our vacation.
