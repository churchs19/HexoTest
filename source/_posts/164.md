I've just released Currency Converter 2005.  Currency Converter 2005 has been completely rewritten with support for Windows Mobile 5 and the new VGA devices. The currency converter uses a webservice provided by [xmethods.net](http://www.xmethods.net) to download the conversion rates. Once downloaded, the rates are then cached for times when the device does not have an active internet connection. The previous version for Pocket PC 2003 and below can be found on my [Other Projects page](OtherProjects.aspx).  Download Currency Converter 2005 on my new [Windows Mobile page](WindowsMobileSoftware.aspx).
