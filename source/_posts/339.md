In just over an hour, the 2008 Rockies season begins in St. Louis versus the Cardinals.  The defending National League Champions (I still get goosebumps saying that!) send Jeff Francis to the hill to begin the defense.  I went out last night and bought a pocket AM radio so I can listen to the games at work as opposed to just watching the MLB GameCast like had in the past.  Unfortunately my cube is not well situated for the radio, but I did find a spot where it will work.  I'm extremely hyped up with excitement today and I can't imagine being all that effective at work on Friday before we go down to Coors Field for the home opener.  It's baseball time!

**Go Rockies!!!**
