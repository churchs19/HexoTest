![Todd Helton celebrates his walk off HR to beat the Dodgers on September 18, 2007](/journal_images/mini-DSC01215-journal.jpg)

Last night, Lauren, Andrea, and I went to watch the Rockies play the Dodgers.  Entering the night, the Rockies were 1 game behind the Dodgers for 3rd place in the Wild Card.  It was a great back and forth game, with both teams' playoff hopes hanging in the balance.

In the bottom of the 9th, the Rockies were trailing 8-7, and the Dodgers brought in Takashi Saito, who hadn't given up a hit to the Rockies all year.  Saito got two quick outs, retiring Omar Quintanilla and Troy Tulowitzki. Matt Holliday came up and laced the first pitch into right field for a single.  Todd Helton came up, and with 2 strikes and the Rockies season in the balance, he crushed an absolute no doubt home run into the Rockies' bullpen for a 9-8 Rockies win!

With the win, the Rox moved into 3rd place in the Wild Card and kept their playoff hopes alive.  Go Rockies!
