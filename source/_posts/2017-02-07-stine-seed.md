Yesterday was my first day at my new job at [Stine Seed](https://www.stineseed.com/) in Dallas Center, Iowa. I'll be doing Angular 2 development as well as full-stack .NET development in support of the research and breeding programs here. It's a pretty small team here, consisting of just 5 full-time developers and one contractor. My first project is working on the user interface for the Breeder Mobile application that will be used on tablets to take field notes on different trials. I'm really excited to be part of the team here and I'm looking forward to learning more about the modern agriculture industry as I go.
