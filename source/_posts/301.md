It's official: October is Rocktober in Colorado!

> WHEREAS, the Colorado Rockies are the centerpiece of Colorado's baseball community, a franchise making only its second playoff appearance since its inception in 1993; and
> 
> WHEREAS, after a late September run of 13 wins in 14 games, the Rockies rekindled the passions of baseball fans across the state and nation and forced a one-game playoff with the San Diego Padres; and
> 
> WHEREAS, on October 1, 2007, Coors Field hosted its most important game in a dozen years, a 13-inning thriller that featured everything we love about the game of baseball - a four hour and forty minute see-saw duel that included five lead changes, dramatic home runs, incredible defensive plays, and a play-at-the-plate finish that sealed the most dramatic victory in Rockies history; and
> 
> WHEREAS, Colorado left its mark on the game of baseball thanks to the many heroes of the Colorado Rockies, including Most Valuable Player hopeful Matt Holliday, who captured the National League batting title and RBI crown on the final night of the season, Rookie of the Year candidate Troy Tulowitzki, who broke the National League record for most home runs in a season by a rookie shortstop and accumulated more assists than any shortstop since Ozzie Smith, manager Clint Hurdle, who deserves due consideration for  Manager of the Year, and veteran first baseman Todd Helton, who will make his first post-season appearance after ten seasons with the Rockies; and
> 
> WHEREAS, the Colorado Rockies have energized people around the state with their remarkable September, and hope to continue one of the most amazing and improbable runs in baseball history;
> 
> Therefore, I, Bill Ritter, Jr., Governor of the State of Colorado, do hereby proclaim October 2007,
> 
> ROCKTOBER!
> 
> in the State of Colorado.
> 
> GIVEN under my hand and the Executive Seal of the State of Colorado, this second day of October, 2007

> Bill Ritter,  Jr.
