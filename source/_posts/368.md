Today is Colorado Primary Day.  Andrea and I went and voted this morning at the Lakewood Public Library.  At 7:30 am, we were voters #2 and #3 in the Democratic Primary.  Not surprisingly, turnout was expected to be low with only one contested primary on our ballot.  We both voted for [Dave Ruchman](http://www.daveruchman.com/) in the HD 24 primary over Sue Schafer.

If you live in Colorado, go vote today!
