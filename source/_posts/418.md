Last night I got a 2008 Trek Madone 4.5 for my birthday from [Wheat Ridge Cyclery](http://www.ridewrc.com).  I had been looking for a bike and Andrea decided to get me one for my birthday.  It's a full carbon frame and is a lot lighter and smoother than anything I've ever ridden before.  As I was looking this time, it took some time to get used to on all of the new bike technology since the last time I rode a bike.  I'm really looking forward to getting out and taking a ride this evening now that it's supposed to be almost 70 degrees here in Denver today.
