It’s been a good week working on preparing for Christmas.  Last Thursday, Ethan helped Andrea and I put up the Christmas Tree in the living room.  He was a really good helper.  For every ornament mommy or daddy put on the tree, he took one off.  Andrea came up with the idea this year of using the Advent calendar that she made to help us build on some repeating family traditions.  Thus far we’ve put up the Christmas tree, had a candy cane pie from Village Inn, and made cookies.  Ethan helped me in the process of making the biscochitos, a traditional New Mexican Christmas cookie.  I’m pretty sure he ate half the dough before we baked it though.  He just loved them.

I’m really thankful to have both of them back around and it is making this holiday season so enjoyable for me.  Pastor Rick commented at church on Sunday how it was so good to see a genuine smile from me and I’m sure it’s not hard for anyone to see how happy I’ve been lately.
