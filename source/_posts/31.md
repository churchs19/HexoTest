You might have noticed that I changed one of the logos on the front page. I've now been working for CH2M Hill for about 2 weeks. It's been a very positive change for me. At the same time I've been incredibly busy. I'm working on a project with a very compressed time schedule which keeps me going all day long. Not that that's a bad thing. :) I'm definitely enjoying the challenge.
