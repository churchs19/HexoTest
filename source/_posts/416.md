I've just released the first public beta of [Stirling Blog](http://www.s-church.net/SmartphoneSoftware.aspx?ID=4) for Windows Mobile Standard (smartphone) devices.  Stirling Blog is a MetaWeblog API client and will work with any blog software that supports the MetaWeblog API (Blogger, Windows Live Spaces, etc.).  The initial beta release of Stirling Blog supports uploading photos from the phone's camera or from a file on the phone, post categories, and setting the post time.  Please see my [Windows Mobile Smartphone Software page](http://www.s-church.net/SmartphoneSoftware.aspx) for full details about Stirling Blog and to download and participate in the beta.
