I finally got around to posting the photos from the Denver Turnverein's Annual Halloween Swing Dance on October 30.  I've been swing dancing since the end of May of this year and I love it.  There's dancing at the Turnverein (16th and Clarkson) every Friday night with a free lesson from 7-8 and then a dance from 8-11:30ish.  You can find more information about swing dancing in Colorado at the [CSDN](http://www.csdn.org) or [23Skidoo](http://www.23skidooland.com/).  The photos are on my [Photo Page](photo.asp) in the Friends section.  Enjoy!
