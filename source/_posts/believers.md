So the World Series is coming back to Denver in the worst case scenario?  We set the record for the worst margin of defeat ever in losing Game 1 13-1.  Game 2 was much better, only losing 2-1, but we still left the bats at home and Matt Holliday took his stupid pill in the 8th.  Now is not the time to turn back into the Rockies of old.  We need to hold serve at Coors and get this series back to Boston.  To quote a sign that we saw a number of times in Coors Field over the last month or so, "It Could Happen!"  Game 3 is at 6:30pm tomorrow, and Andrea and I will be there. 

**Go Rockies!!!**
