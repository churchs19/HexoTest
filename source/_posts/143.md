<font face="Arial">This past weekend I travelled to Austin, TX for the first time to visit my best friend, Greg.  Despite airline delays on both ends of the weekend, it was a good, relaxing weekend.  We spent most of the time playing [NCAA Football 06](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=shanechurch-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B00083G5BM/qid=1128437482/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1?v=glance%26s=videogames%26n=507846), [Civilization 3](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=shanechurch-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B00029QR7O/qid=1128437553/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8__i3_xgl63?v=glance%26s=videogames%26n=541966), and [NHL 2K6](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&camp=1789&tag=shanechurch-20&creative=9325&path=tg/detail/-/B0009XEBWG/qid=1128437628/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8__i2_xgl63?v=glance%26s=videogames%26n=1000).  On Saturday, Greg also took me on a brief tour of Austin where we went to the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas campus.  On the tour I was struck by how amazingly bad the traffic is in this city that is half the size of Denver, though it is much more spread out, and also the sheer number of bronze statues scattered through downtown and the UT campus.   All in all it was a good relaxing weekend and we had a good time just hanging out.  Photos from the weekend are on my [photo page](Photo.aspx).</font>
