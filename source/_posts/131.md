The Rocky Mountain News is reporting on the demolition of the final building at Rocky Flats this week.  Building 371 was the final plutonium building at the site and was far and away the strongest building in Colorado.  It's still amazing to me to see the progress on the site.  In just a few short months, you will be able to drive by the site and not be able to tell that there was ever a nuclear weapons plant there.  While my time at Rocky Flats ended a week ago due to a budget mishap, it has still been surreal to watch this Denver landmark disappear from the horizon.  Read the [Rocky Mountain News article here](http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_3971280,00.html).

There was also more coverage of the ongoing mineral rights negotiations for the [Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge](http://rockyflats.fws.gov/index.htm) in today's [Boulder Daily Camera](http://dailycamera.com/bdc/county_news/article/0,1713,BDC_2423_3970661,00.html).
