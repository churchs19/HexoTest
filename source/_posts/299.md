<font face="Arial" size="3">One more game!  Andrea and I went to the Rockies game this afternoon for the regular season finale.  Everyone in the stadium was watching the Rockies game with one eye, and the San Diego/Milwaukee score on the out of town scoreboard with the other, hoping for a Rockies playoff.  As San Diego fell behind 11-4 (eventually losing 11-6), the stadium cheered every time Milwaukee scored.  Ubaldo Jimenez took a no hitter into the 6th for the Rox and ended up going 6 1/3 innings of shutout ball.  After the San Diego score went final, the Rockies put up 3 runs in the bottom of the 8th to take a 4-1 lead and Coors Field was jumping like I haven't seen since probably 1996 or 1997.  Manny Corpas came on and struggled, giving up 2 runs in the ninth before getting the final out and touching off the final celebration. </font>

<font face="Arial">Andrea and I went to the King Soopers at 17th & Sheridan after the game and stood in line to get tickets for tomorrow's one game NL Wild Card Tiebreaker with San Diego.  The game starts at 5:37 pm Mountain.  **<font color="#800080">Go Rockies!!!</font>**</font>
