Saturday I went up to Boulder and watched the saddest display of football I've seen in a long time. CU got pounded by USC 40-3\. Not only did we get blown out, but it was the worst offensive showing for CU since 1956 and the 3rd worst in school history. The Buffs managed a grand total of 64 yards of offense; only 8 of those in the 2nd half. All I have to say is, "OUCH!" After the game John and I went and played some more NCAA 2003 where I continued my long streak of domination against him. :) On Tuesday, I'll be going to the Avalanche Burgundy and White scrimmage at DU.
