This past weekend I went to Buffalo to visit Andrea.  Remarkably, all of my flights arrived at the destination on time or early (3 of 4 were early), so kudos to [United](http://www.united,com/) for great performance.  Friday morning, Andrea woke up early and wasn't feeling well, so we stayed home most of the day and watched [Rent](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=shanechurch-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000E1YVZU%2Fqid%3D1141229392%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Ddvd%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D130)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=shanechurch-20&l=ur2&o=1).  Friday evening, Andrea was feeling a bit better, so we decided to not cancel her [PAD](http://www.pad.org) dinner and had a bunch of people over.  I ended up doing most of the cooking and the curry and apple crisp both turned out ok.

Saturday we got up and went up to Toronto.  On the way we stopped at Niagara Falls since we both enjoyed seeing it mostly frozen last year.  Unfortunately this year has been too warm and it wasn't nearly as pretty and the wind was bitter cold so we didn't stay long.  Once we got to Toronto, we stopped in the Eaton Centre to go to the Roots store and then to just kill a bit of time before we headed to dinner at the [360 Restaurant in the CN Tower](http://www.cntower.ca/portal/GetPage.aspx?at=860).  At the beginning of dinner, it was so clear that we could see all the way across Lake Ontario to Rochester, NY and then we both enjoyed seeing the weather move in and out across the lake as some scattered snow showers passed in and around the downtown area of Toronto.

Sunday we got up and went up to the Niagara-on-the-Lake wine region in Canada to visit some of our favorite wineries.  We visited [Inniskillin](http://www.inniskillin.com/), [Peller Estates](http://www.peller.com/), [Jackson-Triggs](http://www.jacksontriggswinery.com/), and [Palatine Hills](http://www.palatinehillsestatewinery.com/) before heading back into Niagara-on-the-Lake to have dinner at [The Olde Angel Inn](http://www.angel-inn.com/).  We did some research while we were there on which wines we were capable of getting in Colorado which is unfortunately not very many.  After dinner we drove back across the border to the Buffalo airport so I could head back home.
