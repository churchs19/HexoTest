Today, Andrea and I took Grandpa to the CU-Oklahoma basketball game up in Boulder.  Up in Boulder, we also met John and KT for the game.  It was a great game, with CU winning 72-58 for their second conference win of the season.  It was pretty good crowd and the word of the blackout was spread well.  The CU students started the best chant I've heard in a while at the under 4 minute timeout when it was becoming more clear that CU was going to win, chanting "Just Like Football!" clap--clap--clap-clap-clap, referencing the 27-24 CU upset over #2 Oklahoma this fall.

After the game, we went to dinner with Grandpa at the Madrid Lounge.  It was definitely a fun day.  Go Buffs!
