This afternoon I was laid off by TimeCentre.  I had given my two weeks notice of my resignation on Monday, so the timing was not all bad.  I will now get an extra week of vacation before heading to Des Moines for the wedding on August 14. 

At this point I can also announce that, starting September 5th, I will be working for [Fujitsu Consulting](http://us.fujitsu.com) here in Denver.  I was actually offered the position at the end of June, but we chose to delay my start date until after the wedding to make the logistics easier.

At this point, I'm looking forward to getting married and then coming home and starting a new job after our honeymoon to Italy.
