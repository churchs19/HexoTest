---
Today is Super Tuesday and, for the first time, Colorado is participating.  This will be the first time that I have participated in a precinct caucus here.  I'm definitely excited this time around and I'm looking forward to learning more about this part of the political process.  As is becoming our norm, Andrea and I will be cancelling each other out as I will be caucusing for [Barack Obama](http://www.barackobama.com) and she will be going for Hillary Clinton.  Caucus starts tonight at 7 pm with registration from 6:30-7.
