<font face="Arial">Yesterday morning I drove down to Denver for the Obama rally.  I got downtown right at 11 am and the event was supposed to start at 11:30.  By the time I got there, Civic Center Park was already full of people.  After walking through the crowds around the park, I quickly discovered that there was going to be no way to actually see the stage from in the park.  I ended up going up onto the steps of the Colorado State Capitol, nearly a half mile from the stage.  According to the Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News, the Denver Police estimated the crowd at over 100,000, the largest crowd in the history of Civic Center Park, topping Pope John Paul II in 1993.  Barack Obama led off his speech, asking "Do you ever have small crowds in Denver?" to which the crowd responded, "NO!"  It was an amazing event.</font>
