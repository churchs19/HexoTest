Today I went to the Rockies Opening Day with a number of friends from swing dancing.  Prior to the game, we danced in the inagural Opening Day Parade to represent the [Denver Turnverein](http://www.denverturnverein.org).  The parade was a little disorganized, but it was a lot of fun and I briefly got to talk to Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper.  Following the parade, we danced for a while outside Fado on Wynkoop to advertise for the Turnverein and the Swing Club some more and then went into the game where the Rockies "GenRation" youth movement provided a phenomenal game.  After the Rockies took leads of 4-0 and then 7-3, San Diego stormed back to a 10-8 lead going to the bottom of the 9th.  But then the patented Coors Field comeback struck and the Rockies staged a 4 run rally capped by a 2 run walkoff home run by rookie Clint Barmes to win 12-10.  So the Rockies (picked 29th out of 30 MLB teams by SI) are in first place for at least one day this year and if the rookies keep this up it will be a good year.  Photos from the game are in the [Photo Album](Photo.aspx).
