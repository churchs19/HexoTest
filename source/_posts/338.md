<font face="Arial">Due to some recent changes to the Handango Content Distribution Agreement (CDA), I have stopped offering all of my software through Handango.  Handango's new CDA changes the percentage commission that Handango makes for each sale to 50% on all revenue under $250,000.  As a small developer who makes only a very small amount every year on the applications I offer here,  this represents a very significant change in my revenue stream and, as a result, I have decided to terminate my relationship with Handango.  More information on the changes in the CDA can be found at [Boy Genius](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2008/02/16/handango-revises-cda-says-screw-you-to-developers/), and [Pocket PC Thoughts](http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com/news/show/88336/viva-la-resistance-software-developers-leaving-handango.html).</font>

<font face="Arial">All of my applications are still available through this site and through [MobiHand](http://www.mobihand.com).  Thanks to everyone who has purchased any one of my applications.  I truly appreciate your patronage and your feedback.</font>
