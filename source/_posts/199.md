I don't normally post much about work, but one of my big projects since I've been at TimeCentre was officially released on Monday.  I spent about 4 months working as the sole developer of this first production release of the Pocket PC Time Clock.  This version supports in, out, switch, and lunch punching, validation, and level heirarchies on all Pocket PC 2003 and Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC devices.  The Pocket PC Time Clock is also capable of working in online or offline modes.  Contact [TimeCentre sales](http://www.timecentre.com) for purchasing information.
