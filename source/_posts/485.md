![1](http://www.s-church.net/journal_images/Windows-Live-Writer/What-I-Eat-in-the-Windows-Phone-Store_E24C/1_3.png "1")My second  Windows Phone app, [What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone), has been published to the [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=225b965d-d41f-440b-9e56-f03a550052e8). What I Eat is a simple food journal for Windows Phone. I put it together at Andrea’s request so it is primarily designed as a tool for her, but I hope others find it useful as well. Her complaint about all of the other food journaling apps in the store was that they all were too granular as far as calorie tracking. The existing apps all tie into a calorie database that works well if you go out to eat regularly, but not so well if you cook for yourself. As a result, What I Eat was designed to give greater flexibility in entering information while putting more responsibility for monitoring trends on the user. Check it out and let me know what you think! [What I Eat](/WhatIEat/WindowsPhone) is a free, ad-supported app in the [Windows Phone Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=225b965d-d41f-440b-9e56-f03a550052e8).
