At 2:05 pm today, the Rockies open their 2006 season at Coors Field.  While I won't be able to go this year, Opening Day is always a special day.  Go Rockies!

Update: I've posted a new Rockies Pocket PC theme on my [Pocket PC Themes page](PocketPCThemes.aspx) for Opening Day 2006.

Update 4/4/06: Rockies win 3-2 in 11 innings over the Diamondbacks, moving into first place in the NL West!
