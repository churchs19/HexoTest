<font face="Arial">Yesterday was Grandma Ideker's 85th birthday.  We surprised her for dinner at [240 Union](http://www.240union.com/).  Grandma just expected to have dinner with Grandpa and Doug, but Mom had flown in from Baton Rouge, and Brandon, Tyler, Andrea, and I joined her in the surprise for dinner.  It was a great time and a great celebration of a truly wonderful woman.  Happy Birthday Grandma!</font>
