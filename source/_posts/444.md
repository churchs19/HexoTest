I’m finally updating my site here and I can’t believe it’s really been more than 2 years since I did anything.  And what a crazy 2 years it’s been!  Just a sampling of what’s happened in the last 2 years:

* July 2009
  * Hailstorm hits our house and causes nearly $24,000 in damage.
* September 2009
  * My friend Nick and I are in a bike crash together.  I broke both bones in my right forearm and chipped a front tooth.  I ended up with 2 steel plates and 14 screws in my arm and spent 3 days in the hospital.
  *   Found out Andrea was pregnant!
* June 2010
  * Our first son, Ethan Russell Love-Church is born on June 28th.  He has meconium aspiration and has to be transported to Children’s Hospital in Aurora where they put him on a heart/lung bypass machine for 5 days.  He ends up spending 23 days in the NICU before being released to come home.
* July 2010
  * One week after Ethan is born, while in the hospital with him, I am laid off by CNSI.
  * Grandpa Ideker passes away on July 29th, just one week after Ethan is released from Children’s Hospital.
* September 2010
  * I get a job working at [EffectiveUI](http://www.effectiveui.com).  I have never had this much fun going to work every day or been this challenged on a regular basis.  It is a great environment for me.
* August 2011
  * Yet another bike accident.  This time I was hit by a car.  Fortunately I’m ok, but the bike was totaled.  I ended up getting a new 2012 Trek Madone 4.5 to replace the 2008 Trek Madone 4.5.  It’s a great bike, but I’m still sad that all I have left of my 30th birthday present from Andrea is the pedals and the water bottle holder.

Those of you that know me well will also know that this isn’t a full accounting of everything that’s been going on, but this is the list for public consumption.  Hopefully I’ll be able to post more regular updates here in the near future.
