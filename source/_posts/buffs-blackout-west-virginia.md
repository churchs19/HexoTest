Last night, CU defeated #21 West Virginia 17-14 in OT!  It was a great game and, by far, the best atmosphere I've ever seen at a CU game.  The crowd arrived early and was buzzing from the beginning.  The word of the blackout had been spread well, and  everyone was wearing black from head to toe.  There wasn't an empty seat in the house for the prime time game on ESPN and West Virginia's first trip to the real mountains.

The game got off to a quick start with the Buffs jumping out to a 14-0 lead.  West Virginia answered with a TD, and 7 minutes into the game, CU led 14-7 at the end of the 1st quarter.  From that point the game turned into a real defensive struggle with both teams getting stopped deep in opposing territory.  West Virginia tied the game at 14 in the 4th quarter and neither team could break the tie.

In overtime, CU won the toss and elected to play defense.  West Virginia moved down to the 4 before getting stuffed on 3rd and 1.  West Virginia set up for an extra point length field goal that would have made it 17-14, but their kicker knocked it off the upright; no good!  CU took their offensive turn very conservatively, getting one first down and then lining up for a short winning field goal on 3rd down.  The kick was good giving CU a 17-14 win as the students stormed the field!

It was one of the best college football games that I've been to as the Buffs moved to 3-0 before heading to Jacksonville to take on Florida State next week.  **Go Buffs!**
