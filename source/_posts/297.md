![Helton's walk off home run versus the Dodgers in the 2nd game of the streak on September 18, 2007](/journal_images/RockSolid-Journal.jpg)

<font face="Arial">3 games left!  The Rockies could finish with the best record in the National League...  Or miss the playoffs entirely.  2 games back of Arizona in the NL West with a 3 game series against them remaining.  1 game behind San Diego in the NL Wild Card.  Tied for 2nd in the Wild Card with the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies.  A franchise record 11 game winning streak.  A franchise record 87 wins.  Has it ever been a better time to be a Rockies fan!?!?!?</font>

<font face="Arial">Jeff Francis takes the mound tonight versus Brandon Webb of the Diamondbacks.  The playoffs start start tonight for all intents and purposes.  Win out and we're in.  Lose once and we need a lot of help.  **<font color="#800080">Go Rockies!!!</font>**</font>
