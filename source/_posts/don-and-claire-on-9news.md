As I was getting up this morning, I had the TV on and, during one of the commercials, I realized that I knew some two of the people in them.  Don and Claire Bagge both are long time members of our church and were featured in the [9News](http://www.9news.com) commercial shown above on the coming Digital TV transition.  It's always pretty cool to see someone you know on TV.
