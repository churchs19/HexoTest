Would someone please tell me where the sign on my car that says, "Please Hit Me," is?  Last night I came out of the [Mercury Cafe](http://www.mercurycafe.com) to find that the car who had been parked in front of me had backed into my bumper on the way out.  So I ended up needing to get a police report for the hit and run and I got home a lot later than I would have liked.  Luckily the damage is not bad and it looks like it will just require a sand and repaint, but this is still getting irritating.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions when they do something like this?
