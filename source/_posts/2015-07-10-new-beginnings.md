Today, Andrea, Ethan, Colin, and I left Denver on a new adventure. We're moving to Des Moines, Iowa where I will be starting a new role at [Two Rivers Marketing](http://www.tworiversmarketing.com) on Monday. It's a huge change for me having grown up in New Mexico and Colorado and spending the last 24 years in Denver. Andrea's extended family all lives in and around Des Moines so it will be good for both of the boys to have family around regularly. I'm anxious, yet excited, about the move. It's a big step and the beginning of a new adventure together as a family.
