This past weekend I went to visit Andrea in Buffalo.  On Saturday we slept in because I had arrived so late on Friday night and then we drove to Rochester to tour the [Susan B. Anthony House](http://www.susanbanthonyhouse.org).  After the tour, we drove back to Buffalo and had dinner before going to see Wallace and Gromit.  Sunday we got up early and then went on the [Chautauqua Wine Trail](http://www.chautauquawinetrail.com/) tour through western New York and northeast Pennsylvania.  After we finished the wine trail, we drove up NY-5 back to Buffalo which was a gorgeous drive along Lake Erie with the leaves turning.  We had dinner at Scotch-n-Sirloin before returning to her apartment and spending the rest of the night hanging out with her roommate and her roommate's friends.  Monday we got up and Andrea made quiche and then we just relaxed before I had to go back to the airport for my trip back.  I only made it halfway because my flight from Philadelphia to Denver was overbooked by 30 people, so I took their free round trip offer and stayed overnight before returning to Denver on Tuesday morning.  It was a good trip and we both enjoyed the visit.  Photos from the weekend are on my [Photo Page](PhotoMap.aspx).
