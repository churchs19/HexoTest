We had a wonderful Thanksgiving here.  Andrea prepared a truly incredible meal with 2 turkeys, stuffing, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, risotto, green beans, and rolls for dinner with cranberry bread pudding and pies for dessert.  We ended up having 15 people, counting us, in the house for dinner and everything went really well.

For the rest of the weekend, Andrea and I went to the CU - Nebraska game, and then went shopping and went to Casa Bonita with her family while I went to Red Lobster with mine on Friday.  On Saturday, we went driving in the mountains and then went to White Fence Farm for dinner.  On Sunday we went to church and then relaxed at home before going to see Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium in the evening.  It was a great weekend and a lot of fun.  Andrea truly did a wonderful job cooking her first Thanksgiving dinner and I will be looking forward to the next one.
