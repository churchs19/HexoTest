Today the official handover of the Rocky Flats site from the Department of Energy to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was completed with the announcement of the official establishment of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge.  The Rocky Flats National Wildlife refuge became the 548th unit of the National Wildlife Refuge Complex.  This is a proud day for all of us who worked on the closure and cleanup of the Rocky Flats site, and I will look forward to taking a hike in the former buffer zone once the site is opened to the public.

More information on today's announcement is available at [Senator Ken Salazar's official site](http://salazar.senate.gov/news/releases/070712rckflat.htm).
