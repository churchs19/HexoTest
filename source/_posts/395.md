The New York Times had a really cool article on preserving Buffalo's historic architecture yesterday, entitled ["Saving Buffalo's Untold Beauty."](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/arts/design/16ouro.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink)  While Andrea was in law school at UB, we saw a number of the locations mentioned in the article.  There really is a remarkable amount of history in and around the Buffalo area, and it is good to see that it is being preserved where it can be.  The article definitely brought back some memories of all of the touring that we did around there.
