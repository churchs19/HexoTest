The New York Times ran an article in the Science section today talking about the final phases of the cleanup of Rocky Flats.  The article is really a pretty good summary of the cleanup tasks and the road ahead.  It gets into some of the details of the cleanup levels in the contract and some of the methods used to clean contamination from some of the most dangerous buildings in America.  Click to read [At the Foot of the Rockies, Cleaning a Radioactive Wasteland](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/science/earth/07flat.html) in the New York Times.  The photo above is the demolition of Building 881 which was the first building I worked in.
