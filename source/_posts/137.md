![Jackson Square in New Orleans, August 2000](/journal_images/nojacksonsqkatrina.jpg) <font face="Arial">I have been watching all of the coverage of Hurricane Katrina over the past week, and I am still unable to put real, meaningful words to the disaster.  One of my coworker's parents lost their house on the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain, but thankfully they are among the living.  I keep thinking about the 1.3 million homeless people and the death of a great American city.  New Orleans and the entire Gulf Coast will rebuild and recover, but will never be anything remotely approaching the same.  Donate to the relief and rebuilding efforts at</font> [<font face="Arial">Habitat for Humanity</font>](http://www.habitat.org/)<font face="Arial">,</font> [<font face="Arial">ELCA Disaster Reponse</font>](http://www.elca.org/disaster/)<font face="Arial">, and the</font> [<font face="Arial">American Red Cross</font>](http://www.redcross.org/)<font face="Arial">.  the photo above is one I took in August of 2000 of Jackson Square in New Orleans in happier times.</font>
