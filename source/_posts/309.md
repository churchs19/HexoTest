<font face="Arial">It's 1:30 AM and we just got home from watching the Rockies clinch the 2007 NL Pennant at Coors Field.  What an incredible run!  21 of 22 games.  The first team ever to sweep its way into the World Series.  The NLCS MVP was Matt Holliday as the Rockies beat the D'Backs 6-4.  I'll post more tomorrow when I get a chance.</font>
