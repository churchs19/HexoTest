![Weather Info System Tray 1.4](/software/windows/weather/WeatherInfoTrayScreen.jpg) <font face="Arial">I've just released Weather Info System Tray 1.4.  Weather Info System Tray 1.4 contains a minor bug fix where the Feels Like temperature color on the Current Conditions tab was being set according to the Actual Temperature value as opposed to the Feels Like value.  Download it from my [Windows Software page](WindowsSoftware.aspx).</font>
