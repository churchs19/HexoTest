For the first time, I got an article accepted by [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) and it's on the Slashdot home page right now.

>  CUShane writes _"The Washington Post is running an article on the [patent case between Tivo and EchoStar](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/04/AR2006040400252.html) regarding Tivo's DVR technology. The article states that Tivo has a better than 70% chance of winning, while a loss would basically doom the company. Is there a possibility that the patent system is working right in this case?"_ From the article: _"TiVo attorney Morgan Chu has been arguing in court that TiVo's inability to turn a profit, despite the popularity of its product, is partially because of EchoStar's infringing on its patent. TiVo co-founder Michael Ramsay testified that he showed EchoStar executives the TiVo product and pursued a licensing deal with them, but that a deal was never struck even though EchoStar began selling its own DVRs that used technology very similar to TiVo's."_
