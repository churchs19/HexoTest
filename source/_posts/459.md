I just released my latest tool, [Basecamp People Sync](/BasecampPeopleSync), on my [Windows software page](/Windows).Â  Basecamp People Sync is a Microsoft Outlook 2010 add-in to create or update contacts from your [37signals Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/) account. The add-in displays in the Microsoft Outlook 2010 ribbon in the Add-Ins tab. To update your contacts, simply click the Sync button in the ribbon. The add-in will update the contact's name, IM address, phone numbers, email address, job title, company information and picture. All changes made to any existing contact are saved in the contact's notes field.
