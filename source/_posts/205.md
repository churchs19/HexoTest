On Saturday, Andrea and I went up to see St. Mary's Glacier.  the glacier is located about 6 miles north of Idaho Springs on Fall River Road, and is only about an hour from Denver.  It was a beautiful drive up into the mountains to get to the glacier and the weather was perfect.  St. Mary's Glacier is one of 14 active glaciers in Colorado, and one of the few that is easily accessible to the public.  Check out photos from the hike on my [Photo page](Photo.aspx).
