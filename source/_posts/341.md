First pitch of the 2008 Home Opener is just 4 and a half hours away!  The Rockies return to Coors Field today for the first time since losing Game 4 of the 2007 World Series to the Boston Red Sox.  I've already got my jersey on and I'm ready to head to the ballpark for the game.  This is my first opening day as a season ticket holder and I'm already brimming with excitement.  I'm meeting Dave downtown around 12:30, then we'll grab a bite to eat and head to the ballpark.
