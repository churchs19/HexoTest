Today is election day!  I had planned on taking an early lunch break to miss the lines, but I drove by my polling place on the way to work and there was no line, so I went ahead and voted.  I was ballot 33 at the Lakewood Library this morning. 

If you've been reading my blog, my preferences are clear, but regardless of your political leanings, please vote today!  This is your chance to have a say in your government.  It is not a privilege to be taken lightly.  Vote!
