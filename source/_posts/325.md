We got the final invoice for the Rockies season tickets that we are splitting with the Krells yesterday.  Andrea got me the tickets for Christmas and I couldn't be more excited.  It's only 4 weeks until pitchers and catchers report to spring training!  We will be sitting in Section 304, Row 1, only 3 seats down from where Lauren has her season tickets.  Opening Day is April 4!
