### A simple food journal for Windows Phone

Want to keep track of what you eat but don't want all of the calorie databases and granular measurements? What I Eat is the app for you! You control the granularity and timing of the entries, and you control what you see.

* Export data to Excel via OneDrive for further analysis!
* Color code and categorize entries by meal type.
* Optional synchronization with Windows Azure Mobile Services in preparation for a Windows 8/RT companion
* Full Windows Phone 8 Support
* Machine translated for broad localization!


What I Eat is available in the [Windows Store](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=225b965d-d41f-440b-9e56-f03a550052e8) as a free download.
